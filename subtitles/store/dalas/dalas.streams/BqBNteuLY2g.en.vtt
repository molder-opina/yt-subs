00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
elbow can pop out of place, I don't know, anything like
 

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.430 align:start position:0%
elbow can pop out of place, I don't know, anything like
that, <00:17:32.080><c>right?  </c><00:17:32.680><c>So </c><00:17:33.280><c>the</c>

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
that, right?  So the
 

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.870 align:start position:0%
that, right?  So the
risk <00:17:33.704><c>is </c><00:17:33.968><c>too </c><00:17:34.232><c>high </c><00:17:34.496><c>for </c><00:17:34.760><c>the</c>

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
risk is too high for the
 

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.710 align:start position:0%
risk is too high for the
reward <00:17:35.232><c>you </c><00:17:35.584><c>get.  </c><00:17:35.936><c>That's </c><00:17:36.288><c>why </c><00:17:36.640><c>I</c>

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
reward you get.  That's why I
 

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.549 align:start position:0%
reward you get.  That's why I
recommend <00:17:37.232><c>yujitsu, </c><00:17:37.744><c>which </c><00:17:38.256><c>is </c><00:17:38.768><c>the </c><00:17:39.280><c>least</c>

00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
recommend yujitsu, which is the least
 

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.870 align:start position:0%
recommend yujitsu, which is the least
risky <00:17:40.239><c>compared </c><00:17:40.919><c>to </c><00:17:41.599><c>this.</c>

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.070 align:start position:0%
risky compared to this.
So, <00:17:42.028><c>that's </c><00:17:42.176><c>why </c><00:17:42.324><c>I'm </c><00:17:42.472><c>explaining </c><00:17:42.620><c>all </c><00:17:42.768><c>these </c><00:17:42.916><c>things</c>

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
well, as I was saying about this,
 

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:48.149 align:start position:0%
well, as I was saying about this,
it <00:28:43.486><c>has </c><00:28:43.732><c>a </c><00:28:43.978><c>conversion </c><00:28:44.224><c>rate </c><00:28:44.470><c>of </c><00:28:44.716><c>0.06%.</c>

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
So, <00:28:48.599><c>if </c><00:28:49.039><c>it </c><00:28:49.479><c>gained </c><00:28:49.919><c>6,000 </c><00:28:50.359><c>viewers</c>

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
So, if it gained 6,000 viewers
 

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.830 align:start position:0%
So, if it gained 6,000 viewers
on <00:28:52.792><c>average, </c><00:28:53.504><c>having </c><00:28:54.216><c>had </c><00:28:54.928><c>2,000 </c><00:28:55.640><c>the</c>

previous days, which I'm actually being
a <00:28:57.843><c>little </c><00:28:58.287><c>bit </c><00:28:58.731><c>eh, </c><00:28:59.175><c>I </c><00:28:59.619><c>mean, </c><00:29:00.063><c>on </c><00:29:00.507><c>average </c><00:29:00.951><c>it </c><00:29:01.395><c>had</c>

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit eh, I mean, on average it had
 

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.310 align:start position:0%
a little bit eh, I mean, on average it had
between <00:29:02.140><c>900 </c><00:29:02.560><c>and </c><00:29:02.980><c>1,700, </c><00:29:03.400><c>but </c><00:29:03.820><c>anyway, </c><00:29:04.240><c>let's </c><00:29:04.660><c>say </c><00:29:05.080><c>it</c>

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
between 900 and 1,700, but anyway, let's say it
 

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.870 align:start position:0%
between 900 and 1,700, but anyway, let's say it
had <00:29:05.600><c>2,000 </c><00:29:05.880><c>viewers </c><00:29:06.160><c>on </c><00:29:06.440><c>average, </c><00:29:06.720><c>that</c>

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
had 2,000 viewers on average, that
 

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.590 align:start position:0%
had 2,000 viewers on average, that
means <00:29:07.376><c>it </c><00:29:07.872><c>gained  </c><00:29:08.368><c>6,000 </c><00:29:08.864><c>average </c><00:29:09.360><c>viewers</c>

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
means it gained  6,000 average viewers
 

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.909 align:start position:0%
means it gained  6,000 average viewers
because <00:29:09.806><c>she </c><00:29:10.012><c>had </c><00:29:10.218><c>8,000 </c><00:29:10.424><c>average </c><00:29:10.630><c>viewers </c><00:29:10.836><c>now</c>

00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
because she had 8,000 average viewers now
 

00:29:10.919 --> 00:29:12.269 align:start position:0%
because she had 8,000 average viewers now
.

00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
.
 

00:29:12.279 --> 00:29:14.710 align:start position:0%
.
So, <00:29:12.829><c>that's </c><00:29:13.379><c>a </c><00:29:13.929><c>conversion </c><00:29:14.479><c>of</c>

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
So, that's a conversion of
 

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:19.070 align:start position:0%
So, that's a conversion of
almost <00:29:14.992><c>9.5 </c><00:29:15.264><c>million </c><00:29:15.536><c>of </c><00:29:15.808><c>0.06%. </c><00:29:16.080><c>That</c>

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
almost 9.5 million of 0.06%. That
 

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.190 align:start position:0%
almost 9.5 million of 0.06%. That
's <00:29:19.373><c>the </c><00:29:19.666><c>conversion </c><00:29:19.959><c>this</c>

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
's the conversion this

in his day, I didn't find it funny either, but
 

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.870 align:start position:0%
in his day, I didn't find it funny either, but

that's <00:43:22.151><c>why </c><00:43:22.422><c>I </c><00:43:22.693><c>think </c><00:43:22.964><c>the </c><00:43:23.235><c>UFC </c><00:43:23.506><c>is </c><00:43:23.777><c>not </c><00:43:24.048><c>at </c><00:43:24.319><c>its</c>

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
that's why I think the UFC is not at its
 

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.270 align:start position:0%
that's why I think the UFC is not at its
best <00:43:24.766><c>either, </c><00:43:25.012><c>because </c><00:43:25.258><c>it </c><00:43:25.504><c>has </c><00:43:25.750><c>lost </c><00:43:25.996><c>those</c>

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:29.990 align:start position:0%
best either, because it has lost those

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.190 align:start position:0%
characters that are funny to watch, let's say.
And <00:43:30.193><c>I </c><00:43:30.386><c>think </c><00:43:30.579><c>that's </c><00:43:30.772><c>the </c><00:43:30.965><c>reason </c><00:43:31.158><c>why</c>

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
And I think that's the reason why
 

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.349 align:start position:0%

I was popular in the first place
 

00:43:32.359 --> 00:43:34.349 align:start position:0%
I was popular in the first place
