the idea is that in the only cases
where <01:02:10.990><c>it </c><01:02:11.300><c>seems </c><01:02:11.610><c>right </c><01:02:11.920><c>to </c><01:02:12.230><c>me, </c><01:02:12.540><c>maybe </c><01:02:12.850><c>you've </c><01:02:13.160><c>been</c>

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.390 align:start position:0%
So there's a reconstruction, because you

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.950 align:start position:0%
because if you start giving a reduction, what good does
that <01:02:26.104><c>do </c><01:02:26.488><c>you </c><01:02:26.872><c>exactly?  </c><01:02:27.256><c>There </c><01:02:27.640><c>are</c>

01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
pursue it, and I said yes.
 

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:40.149 align:start position:0%
pursue it, and I said yes.
The <01:17:37.953><c>detective </c><01:17:38.346><c>never </c><01:17:38.739><c>contacted </c><01:17:39.132><c>me </c><01:17:39.525><c>again </c><01:17:39.918><c>and</c>

01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
The detective never contacted me again and
 

01:17:40.159 --> 01:17:42.390 align:start position:0%
The detective never contacted me again and
I <01:17:40.419><c>learned </c><01:17:40.679><c>that </c><01:17:40.939><c>the </c><01:17:41.199><c>person </c><01:17:41.459><c>used </c><01:17:41.719><c>it </c><01:17:41.979><c>again </c><01:17:42.239><c>since</c>

01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
I learned that the person used it again since
 

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.070 align:start position:0%
I learned that the person used it again since
the <01:17:42.613><c>case </c><01:17:42.826><c>was </c><01:17:43.039><c>closed.</c>

01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
the case was closed.
 

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:47.750 align:start position:0%
the case was closed.
Well, <01:17:44.540><c>look, </c><01:17:45.000><c>you </c><01:17:45.460><c>have </c><01:17:45.920><c>to </c><01:17:46.380><c>review </c><01:17:46.840><c>that</c>

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
Well, look, you have to review that
 

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:50.430 align:start position:0%
Well, look, you have to review that
because <01:17:48.143><c>if </c><01:17:48.526><c>you </c><01:17:48.909><c>reported </c><01:17:49.292><c>at </c><01:17:49.675><c>18,</c>

01:17:50.430 --> 01:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
because if you reported at 18,
 

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.110 align:start position:0%
because if you reported at 18,
then <01:17:50.611><c>there's </c><01:17:50.782><c>clearly </c><01:17:50.953><c>no </c><01:17:51.124><c>statute </c><01:17:51.295><c>of </c><01:17:51.466><c>limitations </c><01:17:51.637><c>on</c>

01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
then there's clearly no statute of limitations on
 

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.430 align:start position:0%
then there's clearly no statute of limitations on
that.  <01:17:53.200><c>So </c><01:17:54.280><c>the</c>

01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
that.  So the
 

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:55.669 align:start position:0%
that.  So the
detective <01:17:54.640><c>will </c><01:17:54.840><c>probably </c><01:17:55.040><c>have </c><01:17:55.240><c>gone </c><01:17:55.440><c>through</c>

01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
detective will probably have gone through

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
investigation up to that level, but
 

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:29.510 align:start position:0%
investigation up to that level, but

So you have to look at that and
 

01:18:32.679 --> 01:18:34.669 align:start position:0%
