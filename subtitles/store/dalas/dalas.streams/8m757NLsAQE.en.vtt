00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
was made with at least the second part. I
 

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.150 align:start position:0%
was made with at least the second part. I
don't <00:14:46.723><c>think </c><00:14:46.846><c>so </c><00:14:46.969><c>for </c><00:14:47.092><c>the </c><00:14:47.215><c>first </c><00:14:47.338><c>one; </c><00:14:47.461><c>I </c><00:14:47.584><c>think </c><00:14:47.707><c>the </c><00:14:47.830><c>first </c><00:14:47.953><c>one</c>

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.470 align:start position:0%
don't think so for the first one; I think the first one

because I had to fix a couple of
 

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.269 align:start position:0%
because I had to fix a couple of
things: <01:06:51.848><c>on </c><01:06:52.176><c>some </c><01:06:52.504><c>devices </c><01:06:52.832><c>it </c><01:06:53.160><c>wasn't</c>

01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
read well, like, some
 

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.230 align:start position:0%
read well, like, some
words <01:06:55.537><c>were </c><01:06:55.634><c>cut </c><01:06:55.731><c>off </c><01:06:55.828><c>at </c><01:06:55.925><c>the </c><01:06:56.022><c>end </c><01:06:56.119><c>of </c><01:06:56.216><c>the </c><01:06:56.313><c>pages.</c>

01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
words were cut off at the end of the pages.
 

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.990 align:start position:0%
words were cut off at the end of the pages.
So <01:06:57.551><c>I </c><01:06:57.862><c>fixed </c><01:06:58.173><c>it </c><01:06:58.484><c>for </c><01:06:58.795><c>those</c>

01:06:58.990 --> 01:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
So I fixed it for those
 

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.069 align:start position:0%
So I fixed it for those
devices <01:06:59.659><c>and </c><01:07:00.318><c>that's</c>

01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
devices and that's
 

01:07:02.079 --> 01:07:04.109 align:start position:0%
devices and that's
it. <01:07:02.431><c>But </c><01:07:02.783><c>maybe, </c><01:07:03.135><c>well, </c><01:07:03.487><c>when </c><01:07:03.839><c>it's</c>

01:07:04.109 --> 01:07:04.119 align:start position:0%
it. But maybe, well, when it's
 

01:07:04.119 --> 01:07:06.190 align:start position:0%
it. But maybe, well, when it's
available <01:07:04.479><c>again </c><01:07:04.839><c>I'll </c><01:07:05.199><c>let </c><01:07:05.559><c>you </c><01:07:05.919><c>know</c>

01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
available again I'll let you know
 

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.430 align:start position:0%
available again I'll let you know
so <01:07:06.386><c>you </c><01:07:06.572><c>can </c><01:07:06.758><c>do </c><01:07:06.944><c>another </c><01:07:07.130><c>test, </c><01:07:07.316><c>but</c>

01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
so you can do another test, but
 

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.789 align:start position:0%
so you can do another test, but
yeah, <01:07:07.760><c>basically </c><01:07:08.080><c>that's </c><01:07:08.400><c>the</c>

01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
yeah, basically that's the
 

01:07:08.799 --> 01:07:11.510 align:start position:0%
yeah, basically that's the
main <01:07:09.109><c>reason </c><01:07:09.419><c>why </c><01:07:09.729><c>it's </c><01:07:10.039><c>not </c><01:07:10.349><c>there. </c><01:07:10.659><c>And </c><01:07:10.969><c>then </c><01:07:11.279><c>there</c>

01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
main reason why it's not there. And then there
 

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.990 align:start position:0%
main reason why it's not there. And then there
's <01:07:11.702><c>no </c><01:07:11.884><c>trick, </c><01:07:12.066><c>that's </c><01:07:12.248><c>the </c><01:07:12.430><c>problem, </c><01:07:12.612><c>there's </c><01:07:12.794><c>no</c>

01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
's no trick, that's the problem, there's no
 

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.430 align:start position:0%
's no trick, that's the problem, there's no
