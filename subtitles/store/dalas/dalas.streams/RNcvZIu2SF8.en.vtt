Rixy, shall we?  The why is not there yet.
I'll <00:00:19.624><c>explain </c><00:00:19.768><c>it </c><00:00:19.912><c>to </c><00:00:20.056><c>you, </c><00:00:20.200><c>okay?  </c><00:00:20.344><c>It </c><00:00:20.488><c>turns </c><00:00:20.632><c>out </c><00:00:20.776><c>that </c><00:00:20.920><c>they</c>

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.990 align:start position:0%
I'll explain it to you, okay?  It turns out that they
tested <00:00:21.739><c>a </c><00:00:22.439><c>first </c><00:00:23.139><c>version, </c><00:00:23.839><c>but</c>

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
tested a first version, but
 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.830 align:start position:0%
tested a first version, but
in <00:00:24.880><c>that </c><00:00:25.760><c>approved </c><00:00:26.640><c>version</c>

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
in that approved version
 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.870 align:start position:0%
in that approved version
the <00:00:27.126><c>visits </c><00:00:27.412><c>were </c><00:00:27.698><c>not </c><00:00:27.984><c>working.  </c><00:00:28.270><c>This </c><00:00:28.556><c>was</c>

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
the visits were not working.  This was
 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.509 align:start position:0%
the visits were not working.  This was
due <00:00:29.159><c>to </c><00:00:29.438><c>a </c><00:00:29.717><c>code </c><00:00:29.996><c>refactoring </c><00:00:30.275><c>I</c>

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 align:start position:0%
due to a code refactoring I
 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.549 align:start position:0%
due to a code refactoring I
did <00:00:30.989><c>at </c><00:00:31.459><c>some </c><00:00:31.929><c>point, </c><00:00:32.399><c>and</c>

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
did at some point, and
 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.110 align:start position:0%
did at some point, and
basically <00:00:32.909><c>lives </c><00:00:33.259><c>weren't </c><00:00:33.609><c>being </c><00:00:33.959><c>counted</c>

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
basically lives weren't being counted
 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.150 align:start position:0%
basically lives weren't being counted
, <00:00:34.340><c>so </c><00:00:34.560><c>you'd </c><00:00:34.780><c>finish </c><00:00:35.000><c>a</c>

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
, so you'd finish a
 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.910 align:start position:0%
, so you'd finish a
chapter <00:00:35.419><c>and </c><00:00:35.678><c>it </c><00:00:35.937><c>wouldn't </c><00:00:36.196><c>count </c><00:00:36.455><c>as </c><00:00:36.714><c>a</c>

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
chapter and it wouldn't count as a
 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.950 align:start position:0%
chapter and it wouldn't count as a
new <00:00:37.340><c>visit.  </c><00:00:37.760><c>So </c><00:00:38.180><c>I </c><00:00:38.600><c>had </c><00:00:39.020><c>to </c><00:00:39.440><c>release</c>

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
new visit.  So I had to release
 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.110 align:start position:0%
new visit.  So I had to release
a <00:00:40.300><c>fix, </c><00:00:40.640><c>but </c><00:00:40.980><c>once </c><00:00:41.320><c>I </c><00:00:41.660><c>released </c><00:00:42.000><c>the</c>

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
a fix, but once I released the
 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.630 align:start position:0%
a fix, but once I released the
fix <00:00:42.526><c>I </c><00:00:42.932><c>said, </c><00:00:43.338><c>"Oh, </c><00:00:43.744><c>I'm </c><00:00:44.150><c>here </c><00:00:44.556><c>to</c>

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
fix I said, "Oh, I'm here to
 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.389 align:start position:0%
fix I said, "Oh, I'm here to
fix <00:00:45.010><c>something </c><00:00:45.380><c>else."  </c><00:00:45.750><c>So </c><00:00:46.120><c>I</c>

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
fix something else."  So I
 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.750 align:start position:0%
fix something else."  So I
fixed <00:00:46.779><c>one </c><00:00:47.159><c>more </c><00:00:47.539><c>little </c><00:00:47.919><c>thing </c><00:00:48.299><c>and </c><00:00:48.679><c>sent</c>

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
fixed one more little thing and sent
 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.389 align:start position:0%
fixed one more little thing and sent
this <00:00:49.144><c>one </c><00:00:49.528><c>back </c><00:00:49.912><c>for </c><00:00:50.296><c>review.  </c><00:00:50.680><c>But</c>

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 align:start position:0%

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
So, this way you avoid spam accounts, uh,
 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.830 align:start position:0%
So, this way you avoid spam accounts, uh,
people <00:01:40.513><c>impersonating </c><00:01:40.746><c>you </c><00:01:40.979><c>and </c><00:01:41.212><c>that </c><00:01:41.445><c>kind </c><00:01:41.678><c>of</c>

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.270 align:start position:0%

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
this was a mistake on their part,

this was a mistake on their part,

honestly, because I was testing it
 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.190 align:start position:0%
honestly, because I was testing it
right <00:02:41.079><c>now </c><00:02:41.438><c>on </c><00:02:41.797><c>two </c><00:02:42.156><c>phones </c><00:02:42.515><c>and </c><00:02:42.874><c>the</c>

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.990 align:start position:0%

So, <00:02:46.439><c>most </c><00:02:46.999><c>likely </c><00:02:47.559><c>I </c><00:02:48.119><c>think </c><00:02:48.679><c>that's</c>

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
So, most likely I think that's
 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.430 align:start position:0%
So, most likely I think that's
it, <00:02:49.193><c>I </c><00:02:49.386><c>think </c><00:02:49.579><c>it </c><00:02:49.772><c>was </c><00:02:49.965><c>a </c><00:02:50.158><c>mistake</c>

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
it, I think it was a mistake
 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.350 align:start position:0%
it, I think it was a mistake

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.550 align:start position:0%

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.870 align:start position:0%

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.230 align:start position:0%
think.  Maybe it's not like that, okay?  But I
seem <00:26:31.030><c>to </c><00:26:31.180><c>remember </c><00:26:31.330><c>that </c><00:26:31.480><c>it </c><00:26:31.630><c>was </c><00:26:31.780><c>€500 </c><00:26:31.930><c>for </c><00:26:32.080><c>each</c>

Maybe <00:26:33.662><c>it </c><00:26:33.804><c>was </c><00:26:33.946><c>a </c><00:26:34.088><c>little </c><00:26:34.230><c>less, </c><00:26:34.372><c>maybe </c><00:26:34.514><c>it</c>

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
Maybe it was a little less, maybe it
 

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.750 align:start position:0%
Maybe it was a little less, maybe it
was <00:26:34.715><c>a </c><00:26:34.830><c>little </c><00:26:34.945><c>more, </c><00:26:35.060><c>I </c><00:26:35.175><c>don't </c><00:26:35.290><c>remember </c><00:26:35.405><c>very </c><00:26:35.520><c>well.</c>

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
was a little more, I don't remember very well.
 

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.870 align:start position:0%
was a little more, I don't remember very well.
Okay, <00:26:36.167><c>you </c><00:26:36.574><c>multiply </c><00:26:36.981><c>this </c><00:26:37.388><c>by </c><00:26:37.795><c>the</c>

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
Okay, you multiply this by the
 

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.950 align:start position:0%
Okay, you multiply this by the
number <00:26:38.040><c>of </c><00:26:38.200><c>chapters </c><00:26:38.360><c>there </c><00:26:38.520><c>were, </c><00:26:38.680><c>which </c><00:26:38.840><c>I</c>

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
number of chapters there were, which I
 

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.909 align:start position:0%
number of chapters there were, which I
think <00:26:39.260><c>were </c><00:26:39.560><c>around </c><00:26:39.860><c>20, </c><00:26:40.160><c>I </c><00:26:40.460><c>don't </c><00:26:40.760><c>remember</c>

00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
think were around 20, I don't remember
 

00:26:40.919 --> 00:26:43.510 align:start position:0%
think were around 20, I don't remember
very <00:26:41.229><c>well.  </c><00:26:41.539><c>Okay, </c><00:26:41.849><c>they </c><00:26:42.159><c>were </c><00:26:42.469><c>black </c><00:26:42.779><c>and </c><00:26:43.089><c>white </c><00:26:43.399><c>drawings</c>

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
very well.  Okay, they were black and white drawings
 

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.110 align:start position:0%
very well.  Okay, they were black and white drawings
, <00:26:43.702><c>so </c><00:26:43.884><c>I </c><00:26:44.066><c>don't </c><00:26:44.248><c>have </c><00:26:44.430><c>any </c><00:26:44.612><c>right </c><00:26:44.794><c>now</c>

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.789 align:start position:0%
, so I don't have any right now
.  <00:26:45.314><c>I </c><00:26:45.508><c>don't </c><00:26:45.702><c>have </c><00:26:45.896><c>any </c><00:26:46.090><c>here </c><00:26:46.284><c>right </c><00:26:46.478><c>now.</c>

00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:49.750 align:start position:0%

No, <00:26:47.139><c>I </c><00:26:47.479><c>don't </c><00:26:47.819><c>have </c><00:26:48.159><c>any </c><00:26:48.499><c>here, </c><00:26:48.839><c>but </c><00:26:49.179><c>they </c><00:26:49.519><c>were</c>

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
No, I don't have any here, but they were
 

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.750 align:start position:0%
No, I don't have any here, but they were
black <00:26:50.336><c>and </c><00:26:50.912><c>white </c><00:26:51.488><c>drawings, </c><00:26:52.064><c>okay?  </c><00:26:52.640><c>That</c>

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
black and white drawings, okay?  That
 

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.909 align:start position:0%
black and white drawings, okay?  That
is, <00:26:53.152><c>color </c><00:26:53.544><c>drawings </c><00:26:53.936><c>are </c><00:26:54.328><c>much </c><00:26:54.720><c>more</c>

00:26:54.909 --> 00:26:54.919 align:start position:0%
is, color drawings are much more
 

00:26:54.919 --> 00:26:55.990 align:start position:0%
is, color drawings are much more
complicated <00:26:55.252><c>than </c><00:26:55.585><c>black </c><00:26:55.918><c>and</c>

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
complicated than black and
 

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.389 align:start position:0%
complicated than black and
white <00:26:56.135><c>drawings.  </c><00:26:56.270><c>That's </c><00:26:56.405><c>how </c><00:26:56.540><c>it </c><00:26:56.675><c>is, </c><00:26:56.810><c>everyone </c><00:26:56.945><c>knows </c><00:26:57.080><c>it,</c>

00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
white drawings.  That's how it is, everyone knows it,
 

00:26:57.399 --> 00:27:00.470 align:start position:0%
white drawings.  That's how it is, everyone knows it,
right?  <00:26:57.810><c>It's </c><00:26:58.221><c>black </c><00:26:58.632><c>and </c><00:26:59.043><c>white </c><00:26:59.454><c>so </c><00:26:59.865><c>it's </c><00:27:00.276><c>much</c>

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
right?  It's black and white so it's much
 

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.070 align:start position:0%
right?  It's black and white so it's much
easier <00:27:00.760><c>to </c><00:27:01.040><c>draw, </c><00:27:01.320><c>but </c><00:27:01.600><c>much </c><00:27:01.880><c>easier.</c>

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
easier to draw, but much easier.
 

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.029 align:start position:0%
easier to draw, but much easier.
So, <00:27:03.456><c>this </c><00:27:03.832><c>thing </c><00:27:04.208><c>that </c><00:27:04.584><c>hm </c><00:27:04.960><c>I </c><00:27:05.336><c>don't </c><00:27:05.712><c>know, </c><00:27:06.088><c>is </c><00:27:06.464><c>that </c><00:27:06.840><c>I</c>

00:59:25.559 --> 00:59:27.870 align:start position:0%
n't accept it.  But that does

00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
emulator.  So, I think the person
 

00:59:35.359 --> 00:59:36.549 align:start position:0%
emulator.  So, I think the person
who <00:59:35.467><c>reviewed </c><00:59:35.575><c>it </c><00:59:35.683><c>made </c><00:59:35.791><c>a </c><00:59:35.899><c>mistake </c><00:59:36.007><c>because </c><00:59:36.115><c>the </c><00:59:36.223><c>other </c><00:59:36.331><c>guy </c><00:59:36.439><c>is</c>

00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
who reviewed it made a mistake because the other guy is
 

00:59:36.559 --> 00:59:37.630 align:start position:0%
who reviewed it made a mistake because the other guy is
going <00:59:36.684><c>to </c><00:59:36.809><c>take </c><00:59:36.934><c>a </c><00:59:37.059><c>couple </c><00:59:37.184><c>of </c><00:59:37.309><c>devices </c><00:59:37.434><c>and </c><00:59:37.559><c>it</c>

00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
going to take a couple of devices and it
 

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.950 align:start position:0%
going to take a couple of devices and it
works <00:59:38.179><c>perfectly.  </c><00:59:38.718><c>So </c><00:59:39.257><c>I </c><00:59:39.796><c>think</c>

00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
works perfectly.  So I think
 

00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.670 align:start position:0%
works perfectly.  So I think
it's <00:59:40.319><c>their </c><00:59:40.678><c>problem, </c><00:59:41.037><c>really.</c>

00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's their problem, really.
 

00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.029 align:start position:0%
it's their problem, really.

01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
law that establishes what the rules are,
 

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.629 align:start position:0%
law that establishes what the rules are,
then <01:22:47.951><c>you </c><01:22:48.142><c>have </c><01:22:48.333><c>to </c><01:22:48.524><c>follow </c><01:22:48.715><c>the </c><01:22:48.906><c>rules. </c><01:22:49.097><c>If </c><01:22:49.288><c>they </c><01:22:49.479><c>don't</c>

01:22:49.629 --> 01:22:49.639 align:start position:0%
then you have to follow the rules. If they don't
 

01:22:49.639 --> 01:22:52.510 align:start position:0%
then you have to follow the rules. If they don't
follow <01:22:50.027><c>them, </c><01:22:50.415><c>then </c><01:22:50.803><c>hm, </c><01:22:51.191><c>you </c><01:22:51.579><c>get </c><01:22:51.967><c>into </c><01:22:52.355><c>a</c>

01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
follow them, then hm, you get into a
 

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.229 align:start position:0%
