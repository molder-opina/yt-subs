00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
Uh, well, I'm reading that they do
 

00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:38.950 align:start position:0%

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
combine a little more with punches and
 

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.310 align:start position:0%
combine a little more with punches and

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.549 align:start position:0%
kicks and whatnot, but I'm seeing
that <00:21:41.653><c>it's </c><00:21:41.986><c>very </c><00:21:42.319><c>similar </c><00:21:42.652><c>in </c><00:21:42.985><c>many </c><00:21:43.318><c>other</c>

00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
cosmetic surgeries I've had, and I
 

00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:03.870 align:start position:0%
cosmetic surgeries I've had, and I

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
took them with other things
 

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.190 align:start position:0%
took them with other things
as <00:28:04.182><c>well.  </c><00:28:04.484><c>So </c><00:28:04.786><c>I </c><00:28:05.088><c>see </c><00:28:05.390><c>it </c><00:28:05.692><c>as </c><00:28:05.994><c>very</c>

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
unlikely, really.  Also, look at it
 

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.990 align:start position:0%
unlikely, really.  Also, look at it
because <00:28:07.660><c>it </c><00:28:07.880><c>says </c><00:28:08.100><c>there </c><00:28:08.320><c>the </c><00:28:08.540><c>things </c><00:28:08.760><c>that</c>

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
