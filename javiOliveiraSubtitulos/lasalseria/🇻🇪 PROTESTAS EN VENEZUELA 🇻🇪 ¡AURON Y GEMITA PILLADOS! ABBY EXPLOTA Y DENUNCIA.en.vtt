00:30:52.799 --> 00:30:54.870 align:start position:0%
that explains this and what it refers to
is <00:30:53.360><c>that</c>

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
is that
 

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.549 align:start position:0%
is that
uh <00:30:55.175><c>It's </c><00:30:55.470><c>not </c><00:30:55.765><c>that </c><00:30:56.060><c>they </c><00:30:56.355><c>all </c><00:30:56.650><c>got </c><00:30:56.945><c>the </c><00:30:57.240><c>same</c>

clearly joining them all together, that is to say all of

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
these are supposed to have gotten a 4.6 So
 

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:11.190 align:start position:0%
these are supposed to have gotten a 4.6 So
this

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.549 align:start position:0%
 
is <00:32:11.624><c>clear </c><00:32:12.048><c>is </c><00:32:12.472><c>that </c><00:32:12.896><c>people </c><00:32:13.320><c>are</c>

00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
is clear is that people are

understanding you see look it says
 

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.909 align:start position:0%
understanding you see look it says
132.3 <00:32:17.154><c>because </c><00:32:17.588><c>it </c><00:32:18.022><c>is </c><00:32:18.456><c>incredible </c><00:32:18.890><c>this </c><00:32:19.324><c>is </c><00:32:19.758><c>very</c>

00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
132.3 because it is incredible this is very
 

00:32:19.919 --> 00:32:22.350 align:start position:0%
132.3 because it is incredible this is very
strong <00:32:20.204><c>that </c><00:32:20.489><c>the </c><00:32:20.774><c>rest </c><00:32:21.059><c>are </c><00:32:21.344><c>4.6 </c><00:32:21.629><c>Of </c><00:32:21.914><c>course </c><00:32:22.199><c>but</c>

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
strong that the rest are 4.6 Of course but
 

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.549 align:start position:0%
strong that the rest are 4.6 Of course but
the <00:32:22.679><c>explanation </c><00:32:22.998><c>for </c><00:32:23.317><c>this </c><00:32:23.636><c>is</c>

00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
the explanation for this is
 

00:32:25.559 --> 00:32:28.669 align:start position:0%
the explanation for this is
that <00:32:26.106><c>all </c><00:32:26.653><c>of </c><00:32:27.200><c>these</c>

00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
that all of these
 

00:32:28.679 --> 00:32:34.110 align:start position:0%
that all of these

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
Together they are 4.6 or rather it would be 51.2 44.2
 

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:42.870 align:start position:0%

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
rest but anyway clear it
 

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.470 align:start position:0%
rest but anyway clear it
would <00:32:46.019><c>be </c><00:32:46.198><c>very </c><00:32:46.377><c>clumsy </c><00:32:46.556><c>to </c><00:32:46.735><c>put </c><00:32:46.914><c>a </c><00:32:47.093><c>130 </c><00:32:47.272><c>here</c>
