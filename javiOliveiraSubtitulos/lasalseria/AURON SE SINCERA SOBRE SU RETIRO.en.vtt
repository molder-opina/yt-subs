00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
two or three.  One, two or three.  I think that
 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.270 align:start position:0%
two or three.  One, two or three.  I think that
one <00:00:08.400><c>takes </c><00:00:08.680><c>it </c><00:00:08.960><c>and </c><00:00:09.240><c>leaves.  </c><00:00:09.520><c>I </c><00:00:09.800><c>think, </c><00:00:10.080><c>well,</c>

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
one takes it and leaves.  I think, well,
 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.030 align:start position:0%
one takes it and leaves.  I think, well,
he <00:00:10.508><c>was </c><00:00:10.736><c>retreating, </c><00:00:10.964><c>right?  </c><00:00:11.192><c>If </c><00:00:11.420><c>he </c><00:00:11.648><c>were </c><00:00:11.876><c>to</c>

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
he was retreating, right?  If he were to
 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.910 align:start position:0%
he was retreating, right?  If he were to
suddenly <00:00:12.291><c>retire </c><00:00:12.542><c>right </c><00:00:12.793><c>now, </c><00:00:13.044><c>I </c><00:00:13.295><c>think </c><00:00:13.546><c>he </c><00:00:13.797><c>would</c>

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
suddenly retire right now, I think he would
 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.470 align:start position:0%
suddenly retire right now, I think he would
be <00:00:14.268><c>there </c><00:00:14.616><c>for </c><00:00:14.964><c>a </c><00:00:15.312><c>few </c><00:00:15.660><c>months.  </c><00:00:16.008><c>I'm </c><00:00:16.356><c>not</c>

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
be there for a few months.  I'm not
 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.070 align:start position:0%
be there for a few months.  I'm not
going <00:00:16.660><c>to </c><00:00:16.840><c>tell </c><00:00:17.020><c>you </c><00:00:17.200><c>years, </c><00:00:17.380><c>because </c><00:00:17.560><c>years </c><00:00:17.740><c>might </c><00:00:17.920><c>be</c>

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
going to tell you years, because years might be
 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.790 align:start position:0%
going to tell you years, because years might be
an <00:00:18.280><c>awful </c><00:00:18.480><c>lot, </c><00:00:18.680><c>but </c><00:00:18.880><c>I </c><00:00:19.080><c>think </c><00:00:19.280><c>if </c><00:00:19.480><c>Auron</c>

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
an awful lot, but I think if Auron
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.349 align:start position:0%
an awful lot, but I think if Auron
retires <00:00:20.024><c>for </c><00:00:20.248><c>a </c><00:00:20.472><c>few </c><00:00:20.696><c>months, </c><00:00:20.920><c>he</c>

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
retires for a few months, he
 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.189 align:start position:0%
retires for a few months, he
would <00:00:21.564><c>still </c><00:00:21.769><c>be </c><00:00:21.974><c>making </c><00:00:22.179><c>money, </c><00:00:22.384><c>a </c><00:00:22.589><c>lot </c><00:00:22.794><c>of</c>

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
would still be making money, a lot of
 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.150 align:start position:0%
would still be making money, a lot of
money.  <00:00:23.433><c>It's </c><00:00:23.667><c>been </c><00:00:23.901><c>many </c><00:00:24.135><c>years, </c><00:00:24.369><c>it's </c><00:00:24.603><c>been </c><00:00:24.837><c>many</c>

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
money.  It's been many years, it's been many
 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.109 align:start position:0%
