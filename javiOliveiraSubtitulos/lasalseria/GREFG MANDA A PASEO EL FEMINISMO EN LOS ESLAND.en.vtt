00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
YouTube, so I think if we put in a
 

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:11.910 align:start position:0%
YouTube, so I think if we put in a

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
first I think it's a decision that
 

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.870 align:start position:0%
first I think it's a decision that
the <00:14:14.100><c>streamers </c><00:14:14.600><c>have </c><00:14:15.100><c>to </c><00:14:15.600><c>make, </c><00:14:16.100><c>uh, </c><00:14:16.600><c>the</c>

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
the streamers have to make, uh, the

the streamers have to make, uh, the

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
streamers, I agree. I think it's a
 

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.629 align:start position:0%
streamers, I agree. I think it's a
decision <00:14:19.560><c>that</c>

00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
decision that
 

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:24.030 align:start position:0%
decision that
the <00:14:20.990><c>women </c><00:14:21.341><c>have </c><00:14:21.692><c>to </c><00:14:22.043><c>decide, </c><00:14:22.394><c>the </c><00:14:22.745><c>girls, </c><00:14:23.096><c>I </c><00:14:23.447><c>agree. </c><00:14:23.798><c>And</c>

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
the women have to decide, the girls, I agree. And
 

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.749 align:start position:0%
the women have to decide, the girls, I agree. And
then <00:14:24.744><c>I </c><00:14:25.448><c>think </c><00:14:26.152><c>that </c><00:14:26.856><c>category </c><00:14:27.560><c>would</c>

00:14:27.749 --> 00:14:27.759 align:start position:0%
then I think that category would
 

00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:30.389 align:start position:0%
then I think that category would
