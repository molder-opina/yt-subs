a little bit I'll also tell you the direction of the

00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:27.959 align:start position:0%
tournament I think it would have been very
 

00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:29.310 align:start position:0%
tournament I think it would have been very
different <00:14:28.279><c>if </c><00:14:28.599><c>we </c><00:14:28.919><c>had </c><00:14:29.239><c>started</c>
