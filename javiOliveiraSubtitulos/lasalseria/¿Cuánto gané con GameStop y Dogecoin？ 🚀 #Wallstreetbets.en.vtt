00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:41.799 align:start position:0%
purchases it almost went to 132 it didn't go
 

00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
purchases it almost went to 132 it didn't go
down <00:20:42.030><c>to </c><00:20:42.261><c>160 </c><00:20:42.492><c>it </c><00:20:42.723><c>has </c><00:20:42.954><c>marked </c><00:20:43.185><c>us </c><00:20:43.416><c>well</c>

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:43.570 align:start position:0%
down to 160 it has marked us well
 

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.210 align:start position:0%
down to 160 it has marked us well
so <00:20:43.712><c>it's </c><00:20:43.854><c>because </c><00:20:43.996><c>they </c><00:20:44.138><c>were </c><00:20:44.280><c>smaller </c><00:20:44.422><c>that </c><00:20:44.564><c>they </c><00:20:44.706><c>are</c>

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:45.220 align:start position:0%
so it's because they were smaller that they are
 

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:49.470 align:start position:0%
so it's because they were smaller that they are
worth <00:20:45.595><c>more </c><00:20:45.970><c>days </c><00:20:46.345><c>but </c><00:20:46.720><c>it </c><00:20:47.095><c>reached </c><00:20:47.470><c>112</c>

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
