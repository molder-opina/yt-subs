00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
say it. For example, Rico, and now
 

00:38:37.599 --> 00:38:39.510 align:start position:0%
say it. For example, Rico, and now
that <00:38:37.794><c>they've </c><00:38:37.989><c>put </c><00:38:38.184><c>the </c><00:38:38.379><c>van </c><00:38:38.574><c>on </c><00:38:38.769><c>him, </c><00:38:38.964><c>he's </c><00:38:39.159><c>spoken </c><00:38:39.354><c>very</c>

that they've put the van on him, he's spoken very

that they've put the van on him, he's spoken very

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
clearly. And I think that is the key.
 

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.109 align:start position:0%
clearly. And I think that is the key.
So <00:38:44.194><c>if </c><00:38:44.468><c>you </c><00:38:44.742><c>speak </c><00:38:45.016><c>clearly, </c><00:38:45.290><c>in </c><00:38:45.564><c>the </c><00:38:45.838><c>end</c>

00:38:46.109 --> 00:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
So if you speak clearly, in the end
 

00:38:46.119 --> 00:38:47.710 align:start position:0%
So if you speak clearly, in the end
