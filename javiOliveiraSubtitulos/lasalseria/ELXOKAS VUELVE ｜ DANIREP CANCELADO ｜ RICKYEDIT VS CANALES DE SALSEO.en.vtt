00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.690 align:start position:0%
 
not <00:27:56.857><c>going </c><00:27:57.194><c>to </c><00:27:57.531><c>blur </c><00:27:57.868><c>the </c><00:27:58.205><c>background </c><00:27:58.542><c>let's </c><00:27:58.879><c>see </c><00:27:59.216><c>and</c>

00:27:59.690 --> 00:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
not going to blur the background let's see and
 

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.990 align:start position:0%
not going to blur the background let's see and
the <00:27:59.913><c>other </c><00:28:00.126><c>Ah </c><00:28:00.339><c>but </c><00:28:00.552><c>the </c><00:28:00.765><c>other </c><00:28:00.978><c>one </c><00:28:01.191><c>looks </c><00:28:01.404><c>very </c><00:28:01.617><c>I</c>

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
the other Ah but the other one looks very I
 

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.090 align:start position:0%
the other Ah but the other one looks very I
think <00:28:03.257><c>that </c><00:28:03.514><c>in </c><00:28:03.771><c>24 </c><00:28:04.028><c>millimeters </c><00:28:04.285><c>it </c><00:28:04.542><c>would </c><00:28:04.799><c>look</c>

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
think that in 24 millimeters it would look
 

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.669 align:start position:0%
think that in 24 millimeters it would look
good <00:28:05.434><c>and </c><00:28:05.768><c>this </c><00:28:06.102><c>as </c><00:28:06.436><c>you </c><00:28:06.770><c>know </c><00:28:07.104><c>the </c><00:28:07.438><c>millimeters</c>

00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
good and this as you know the millimeters
 

00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:09.950 align:start position:0%
good and this as you know the millimeters
that <00:28:07.889><c>is </c><00:28:08.099><c>because </c><00:28:08.309><c>they </c><00:28:08.519><c>put</c>

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
that is because they put
 

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:15.409 align:start position:0%
that is because they put
these <00:28:10.470><c>42 </c><00:28:10.980><c>millimeters </c><00:28:11.490><c>it </c><00:28:12.000><c>says</c>
