00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
says, "He knew everything."  So Fran
 

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.150 align:start position:0%
says, "He knew everything."  So Fran

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
Cuesta was right and told him everything and
 

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.470 align:start position:0%
Cuesta was right and told him everything and

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
he can destroy it.  So if he knew
 

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.190 align:start position:0%
he can destroy it.  So if he knew
everything, <00:08:46.674><c>why </c><00:08:46.868><c>is </c><00:08:47.062><c>he </c><00:08:47.256><c>only </c><00:08:47.450><c>getting </c><00:08:47.644><c>offended </c><00:08:47.838><c>now</c>
