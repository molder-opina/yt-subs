is ambiguous like the parrot thing, right?
 

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.230 align:start position:0%
is ambiguous like the parrot thing, right?
First <00:42:03.626><c>he </c><00:42:03.852><c>says </c><00:42:04.078><c>Javi </c><00:42:04.304><c>has </c><00:42:04.530><c>a </c><00:42:04.756><c>contract,</c>

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
man.  Lui has a contract, so he
 

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.270 align:start position:0%
man.  Lui has a contract, so he
's <00:42:06.965><c>not </c><00:42:07.210><c>so </c><00:42:07.455><c>blunt, </c><00:42:07.700><c>leaving </c><00:42:07.945><c>the </c><00:42:08.190><c>message </c><00:42:08.435><c>vague.   </c><00:42:08.680><c>I</c>
