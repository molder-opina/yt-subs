00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
more muscle the greater the metabolism and
 

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.510 align:start position:0%
more muscle the greater the metabolism and

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
therefore greater caloric expenditure at

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
rest Alex because he because he says that

rest Alex because he because he says that
with <00:25:13.271><c>strength </c><00:25:13.902><c>you </c><00:25:14.533><c>lose </c><00:25:15.164><c>fewer </c><00:25:15.795><c>calories</c>

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
with strength you lose fewer calories
 

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.750 align:start position:0%
with strength you lose fewer calories

00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
think it's a decision that
 

00:47:07.559 --> 00:47:11.109 align:start position:0%
think it's a decision that
the <00:47:08.050><c>streamers </c><00:47:08.541><c>have </c><00:47:09.032><c>to </c><00:47:09.523><c>make </c><00:47:10.014><c>eh </c><00:47:10.505><c>the </c><00:47:10.996><c>streamers</c>

00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
the streamers have to make eh the streamers
 

00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:12.870 align:start position:0%
the streamers have to make eh the streamers
agree <00:47:11.392><c>I </c><00:47:11.665><c>think </c><00:47:11.938><c>it's </c><00:47:12.211><c>a </c><00:47:12.484><c>decision </c><00:47:12.757><c>that</c>

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:14.470 align:start position:0%
agree I think it's a decision that
 

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:18.390 align:start position:0%
 
the <00:47:14.920><c>women </c><00:47:15.360><c>have </c><00:47:15.800><c>to </c><00:47:16.240><c>decide </c><00:47:16.680><c>the </c><00:47:17.120><c>girls </c><00:47:17.560><c>agree </c><00:47:18.000><c>and</c>

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
the women have to decide the girls agree and
 

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.390 align:start position:0%
the women have to decide the girls agree and
then <00:47:18.720><c>I </c><00:47:19.040><c>think </c><00:47:19.360><c>that </c><00:47:19.680><c>category </c><00:47:20.000><c>would</c>

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
then I think that category would
 

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.390 align:start position:0%
then I think that category would
somehow <00:47:24.180><c>bring </c><00:47:25.960><c>more</c>

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
somehow bring more
 

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.790 align:start position:0%
somehow bring more
bad <00:47:26.710><c>things </c><00:47:27.020><c>than </c><00:47:27.330><c>good </c><00:47:27.640><c>or </c><00:47:27.950><c>rather </c><00:47:28.260><c>that </c><00:47:28.570><c>category </c><00:47:28.880><c>would</c>

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
