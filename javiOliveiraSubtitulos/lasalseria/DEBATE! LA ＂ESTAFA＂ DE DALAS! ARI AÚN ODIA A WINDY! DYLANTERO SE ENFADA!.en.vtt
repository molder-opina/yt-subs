00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.990 align:start position:0%
investment capacity then Then
let's <00:36:57.140><c>say </c><00:36:57.400><c>the </c><00:36:57.660><c>coin </c><00:36:57.920><c>that </c><00:36:58.180><c>you </c><00:36:58.440><c>are</c>

00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
let's say the coin that you are
 

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.990 align:start position:0%
let's say the coin that you are
buying <00:36:59.552><c>loses </c><00:37:00.104><c>10% </c><00:37:00.656><c>of </c><00:37:01.208><c>value </c><00:37:01.760><c>that</c>

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
buying loses 10% of value that
 

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.069 align:start position:0%
buying loses 10% of value that
It <00:37:02.210><c>would </c><00:37:02.420><c>mean </c><00:37:02.630><c>that </c><00:37:02.840><c>when </c><00:37:03.050><c>you </c><00:37:03.260><c>make </c><00:37:03.470><c>your </c><00:37:03.680><c>move</c>

00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
It would mean that when you make your move
 

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:06.349 align:start position:0%
It would mean that when you make your move
how <00:37:04.372><c>you </c><00:37:04.665><c>bought </c><00:37:04.958><c>100 </c><00:37:05.251><c>but </c><00:37:05.544><c>lost </c><00:37:05.837><c>10%</c>

00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
how you bought 100 but lost 10%
 

00:37:06.359 --> 00:37:09.230 align:start position:0%
how you bought 100 but lost 10%
how <00:37:06.667><c>much </c><00:37:06.975><c>would </c><00:37:07.283><c>you </c><00:37:07.591><c>lose </c><00:37:07.899><c>10 </c><00:37:08.207><c>true </c><00:37:08.515><c>because</c>

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
how much would you lose 10 true because
 

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.589 align:start position:0%
how much would you lose 10 true because
You <00:37:09.444><c>bought </c><00:37:09.648><c>100 </c><00:37:09.852><c>and </c><00:37:10.056><c>they </c><00:37:10.260><c>lost </c><00:37:10.464><c>10% </c><00:37:10.668><c>of </c><00:37:10.872><c>their </c><00:37:11.076><c>value.</c>

00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
You bought 100 and they lost 10% of their value.
 

00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:13.950 align:start position:0%
You bought 100 and they lost 10% of their value.
So <00:37:11.907><c>you're </c><00:37:12.215><c>left </c><00:37:12.523><c>with </c><00:37:12.831><c>90 </c><00:37:13.139><c>But </c><00:37:13.447><c>what </c><00:37:13.755><c>happens?</c>

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
So you're left with 90 But what happens?
 

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.510 align:start position:0%
So you're left with 90 But what happens?
when <00:37:14.299><c>you </c><00:37:14.638><c>have </c><00:37:14.977><c>leverage </c><00:37:15.316><c>by</c>

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
when you have leverage by

when you have leverage by

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
10 Well, it turns out that this is multiplied
 

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.950 align:start position:0%
10 Well, it turns out that this is multiplied
Then <00:37:18.965><c>you </c><00:37:19.210><c>would </c><00:37:19.455><c>no </c><00:37:19.700><c>longer </c><00:37:19.945><c>lose </c><00:37:20.190><c>only </c><00:37:20.435><c>10 </c><00:37:20.680><c>If</c>

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
Then you would no longer lose only 10 If
 

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.470 align:start position:0%
Then you would no longer lose only 10 If
you <00:37:21.326><c>don't </c><00:37:21.692><c>lose </c><00:37:22.058><c>100 </c><00:37:22.424><c>you </c><00:37:22.790><c>practically </c><00:37:23.156><c>lose</c>

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
you don't lose 100 you practically lose
 

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.309 align:start position:0%
you don't lose 100 you practically lose
All <00:37:23.693><c>that </c><00:37:23.906><c>is </c><00:37:24.119><c>the </c><00:37:24.332><c>risk </c><00:37:24.545><c>of </c><00:37:24.758><c>leverage</c>

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
All that is the risk of leverage
 

00:37:25.319 --> 00:37:28.069 align:start position:0%
All that is the risk of leverage
when <00:37:25.555><c>it </c><00:37:25.791><c>is </c><00:37:26.027><c>very </c><00:37:26.263><c>high </c><00:37:26.499><c>it </c><00:37:26.735><c>was </c><00:37:26.971><c>was </c><00:37:27.207><c>was </c><00:37:27.443><c>by </c><00:37:27.679><c>1000</c>
