00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
I think this is the the the proof
 

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.629 align:start position:0%
I think this is the the the proof
Although <00:31:17.485><c>it </c><00:31:17.770><c>is </c><00:31:18.055><c>quite </c><00:31:18.340><c>redundant </c><00:31:18.625><c>no </c><00:31:18.910><c>and </c><00:31:19.195><c>it </c><00:31:19.480><c>is</c>
