because there are no more tests today, then
you <00:33:01.602><c>can </c><00:33:01.884><c>do </c><00:33:02.166><c>a </c><00:33:02.448><c>mental </c><00:33:02.730><c>reset </c><00:33:03.012><c>and </c><00:33:03.294><c>be</c>

00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
you can do a mental reset and be
 

00:33:03.659 --> 00:33:05.990 align:start position:0%
you can do a mental reset and be

00:33:08.159 --> 00:33:10.190 align:start position:0%
eliminated, I mean. So it's a
bit <00:33:08.459><c>of </c><00:33:08.759><c>what </c><00:33:09.059><c>you </c><00:33:09.359><c>both </c><00:33:09.659><c>decide, </c><00:33:09.959><c>but</c>

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
bit of what you both decide, but
 

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.389 align:start position:0%
bit of what you both decide, but
if <00:33:10.379><c>you </c><00:33:10.558><c>both </c><00:33:10.737><c>want </c><00:33:10.916><c>to </c><00:33:11.095><c>do </c><00:33:11.274><c>it</c>

00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
if you both want to do it
 

00:33:11.399 --> 00:33:12.950 align:start position:0%
if you both want to do it
fairly <00:33:11.519><c>and </c><00:33:11.639><c>repeat </c><00:33:11.759><c>it, </c><00:33:11.879><c>I </c><00:33:11.999><c>think </c><00:33:12.119><c>you </c><00:33:12.239><c>should </c><00:33:12.359><c>do </c><00:33:12.479><c>it</c>

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
