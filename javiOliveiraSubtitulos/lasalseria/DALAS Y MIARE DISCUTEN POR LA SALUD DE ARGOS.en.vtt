00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 align:start position:0%
sarcoma here.  So I wonder when
 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.429 align:start position:0%
sarcoma here.  So I wonder when
exactly <00:01:53.249><c>he's </c><00:01:53.739><c>lying.  </c><00:01:54.229><c>And </c><00:01:54.719><c>so</c>

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
exactly he's lying.  And so
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.749 align:start position:0%
exactly he's lying.  And so
basically, <00:01:55.772><c>well, </c><00:01:56.105><c>a </c><00:01:56.438><c>lump</c>

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 align:start position:0%
basically, well, a lump
 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.429 align:start position:0%
basically, well, a lump
can <00:01:56.970><c>be </c><00:01:57.181><c>a </c><00:01:57.392><c>sarcoma, </c><00:01:57.603><c>right?  </c><00:01:57.814><c>I </c><00:01:58.025><c>mean, </c><00:01:58.236><c>a</c>

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
can be a sarcoma, right?  I mean, a
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.109 align:start position:0%
can be a sarcoma, right?  I mean, a
lump <00:01:58.832><c>can </c><00:01:59.225><c>be </c><00:01:59.618><c>benign </c><00:02:00.011><c>or </c><00:02:00.404><c>malignant, </c><00:02:00.797><c>but</c>

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
lump can be benign or malignant, but
 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.590 align:start position:0%
lump can be benign or malignant, but
of <00:02:01.296><c>course, </c><00:02:01.473><c>sarcoma, </c><00:02:01.650><c>what </c><00:02:01.827><c>would </c><00:02:02.004><c>it </c><00:02:02.181><c>be?  </c><00:02:02.358><c>only</c>

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 align:start position:0%
of course, sarcoma, what would it be?  only
 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.350 align:start position:0%
of course, sarcoma, what would it be?  only
evil.  <00:02:02.873><c>I </c><00:02:03.146><c>think </c><00:02:03.419><c>it </c><00:02:03.692><c>will </c><00:02:03.965><c>be </c><00:02:04.238><c>a</c>

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
evil.  I think it will be a
 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.630 align:start position:0%

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 align:start position:0%

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
be malignant.  That's what I think
 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.910 align:start position:0%
be malignant.  That's what I think
will <00:02:08.289><c>be </c><00:02:08.498><c>more </c><00:02:08.707><c>or </c><00:02:08.916><c>less </c><00:02:09.125><c>the </c><00:02:09.334><c>real </c><00:02:09.543><c>thing, </c><00:02:09.752><c>the</c>
