00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.429 align:start position:0%

man, <00:00:33.544><c>it </c><00:00:33.768><c>wasn't </c><00:00:33.992><c>because </c><00:00:34.216><c>maybe </c><00:00:34.440><c>it</c>

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
man, it wasn't because maybe it
 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.750 align:start position:0%
man, it wasn't because maybe it

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
shame. Both Rubius and I participated and we
 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.190 align:start position:0%
shame. Both Rubius and I participated and we
could <00:00:43.540><c>win. </c><00:00:43.800><c>I </c><00:00:44.060><c>mean, </c><00:00:44.320><c>no, </c><00:00:44.580><c>before, </c><00:00:44.840><c>because</c>

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
could win. I mean, no, before, because
 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.869 align:start position:0%
could win. I mean, no, before, because
we <00:00:45.471><c>knew </c><00:00:45.742><c>practically </c><00:00:46.013><c>all </c><00:00:46.284><c>the </c><00:00:46.555><c>tests,</c>

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 align:start position:0%
we knew practically all the tests,
 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.350 align:start position:0%
we knew practically all the tests,
so <00:00:47.062><c>it </c><00:00:47.245><c>wasn't </c><00:00:47.428><c>fair. </c><00:00:47.611><c>But </c><00:00:47.794><c>this </c><00:00:47.977><c>time </c><00:00:48.160><c>we</c>

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't fair. But this time we
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.029 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't fair. But this time we
could <00:00:48.663><c>win. </c><00:00:48.966><c>Why? </c><00:00:49.269><c>Because </c><00:00:49.572><c>we're </c><00:00:49.875><c>in</c>

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 align:start position:0%
could win. Why? Because we're in
 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.750 align:start position:0%
could win. Why? Because we're in
the <00:00:50.335><c>organization, </c><00:00:50.631><c>but </c><00:00:50.927><c>we </c><00:00:51.223><c>haven't </c><00:00:51.519><c>gotten</c>

the squid games being made. Now I don't
agree <00:01:05.253><c>and </c><00:01:05.506><c>so </c><00:01:05.759><c>we </c><00:01:06.012><c>moved </c><00:01:06.265><c>it </c><00:01:06.518><c>to</c>
