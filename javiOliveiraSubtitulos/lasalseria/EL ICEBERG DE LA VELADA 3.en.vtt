00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay I think the reality of this that we will
 

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.169 align:start position:0%
okay I think the reality of this that we will
never <00:18:43.080><c>really </c><00:18:43.680><c>know </c><00:18:44.280><c>tesa </c><00:18:44.880><c>just</c>

00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
a little bit more than 4 and a half million,
 

00:19:39.059 --> 00:19:42.049 align:start position:0%
a little bit more than 4 and a half million,
okay, <00:19:39.519><c>it </c><00:19:39.979><c>wouldn't </c><00:19:40.439><c>reach </c><00:19:40.899><c>600,000. </c><00:19:41.359><c>Quevedo's </c><00:19:41.819><c>performance</c>

00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:42.059 align:start position:0%

00:19:42.059 --> 00:19:46.390 align:start position:0%
okay, it wouldn't reach 600,000. Quevedo's performance
probably <00:19:42.599><c>did. </c><00:19:43.139><c>It </c><00:19:43.679><c>went </c><00:19:44.219><c>to </c><00:19:44.759><c>3 </c><00:19:45.299><c>million,</c>

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
probably did. It went to 3 million,
