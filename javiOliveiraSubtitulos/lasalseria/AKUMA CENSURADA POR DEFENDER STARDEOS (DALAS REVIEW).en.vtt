01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
dedicated but what we are going to do
now <01:04:33.552><c>next </c><01:04:33.924><c>is </c><01:04:34.296><c>instead </c><01:04:34.668><c>of </c><01:04:35.040><c>that</c>

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:36.290 align:start position:0%
now next is instead of that
 

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:41.570 align:start position:0%
now next is instead of that
have <01:04:37.055><c>in </c><01:04:37.820><c>a </c><01:04:38.585><c>type </c><01:04:39.350><c>d</c>

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.990 align:start position:0%
 
so <01:04:41.957><c>that </c><01:04:42.334><c>you </c><01:04:42.711><c>understand </c><01:04:43.088><c>it </c><01:04:43.465><c>is </c><01:04:43.842><c>like </c><01:04:44.219><c>several</c>

01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
so that you understand it is like several
 

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.230 align:start position:0%
so that you understand it is like several
servers <01:04:45.735><c>that </c><01:04:46.470><c>access </c><01:04:47.205><c>many </c><01:04:47.940><c>resources</c>

01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
servers that access many resources
 

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.770 align:start position:0%
servers that access many resources
and <01:04:48.602><c>can </c><01:04:48.964><c>be </c><01:04:49.326><c>expanded </c><01:04:49.688><c>or </c><01:04:50.050><c>lowered </c><01:04:50.412><c>at </c><01:04:50.774><c>will</c>

and can be expanded or lowered at will
 

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:54.110 align:start position:0%
and can be expanded or lowered at will
so <01:04:52.100><c>if </c><01:04:52.420><c>we </c><01:04:52.740><c>have </c><01:04:53.060><c>many </c><01:04:53.380><c>users </c><01:04:53.700><c>and</c>

01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
so if we have many users and
 

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.250 align:start position:0%
so if we have many users and
we <01:04:54.243><c>increase </c><01:04:54.366><c>in </c><01:04:54.489><c>a </c><01:04:54.612><c>matter </c><01:04:54.735><c>of </c><01:04:54.858><c>minutes </c><01:04:54.981><c>we </c><01:04:55.104><c>have</c>

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
we increase in a matter of minutes we have
 

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:58.310 align:start position:0%
we increase in a matter of minutes we have
few <01:04:55.848><c>we </c><01:04:56.436><c>lower </c><01:04:57.024><c>it </c><01:04:57.612><c>so </c><01:04:58.200><c>that's</c>

01:04:58.310 --> 01:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
few we lower it so that's
 

01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.570 align:start position:0%
few we lower it so that's
how <01:04:58.487><c>we're </c><01:04:58.654><c>going </c><01:04:58.821><c>to </c><01:04:58.988><c>proceed </c><01:04:59.155><c>from </c><01:04:59.322><c>now </c><01:04:59.489><c>on</c>

01:04:59.570 --> 01:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
how we're going to proceed from now on
 

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.250 align:start position:0%
how we're going to proceed from now on

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm pretty confident that
 

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm pretty confident that

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:21.260 align:start position:0%
we did it works perfectly the problem
itself <01:07:18.967><c>wasn't </c><01:07:19.274><c>that </c><01:07:19.581><c>it </c><01:07:19.888><c>had </c><01:07:20.195><c>to </c><01:07:20.502><c>be </c><01:07:20.809><c>done </c><01:07:21.116><c>better</c>

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:21.270 align:start position:0%
itself wasn't that it had to be done better
 

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:22.970 align:start position:0%
itself wasn't that it had to be done better
that <01:07:21.505><c>also </c><01:07:21.740><c>because </c><01:07:21.975><c>everything </c><01:07:22.210><c>can </c><01:07:22.445><c>be </c><01:07:22.680><c>improved</c>

01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
that also because everything can be improved
 

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:25.370 align:start position:0%
that also because everything can be improved
okay <01:07:23.300><c>the </c><01:07:23.620><c>problem </c><01:07:23.940><c>was </c><01:07:24.260><c>that </c><01:07:24.580><c>too </c><01:07:24.900><c>many</c>

01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
people came that problem really if we
 

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:28.970 align:start position:0%
people came that problem really if we
