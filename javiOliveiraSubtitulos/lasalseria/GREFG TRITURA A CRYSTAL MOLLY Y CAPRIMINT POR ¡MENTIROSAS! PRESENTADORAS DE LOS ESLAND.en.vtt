So you want that she does not add to the
 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.869 align:start position:0%
So you want that she does not add to the
events <00:00:54.325><c>she </c><00:00:54.611><c>can </c><00:00:54.897><c>also </c><00:00:55.183><c>add </c><00:00:55.469><c>to </c><00:00:55.755><c>the</c>

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
events then there if you are doing
 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.150 align:start position:0%
events then there if you are doing
a <00:00:57.648><c>job </c><00:00:58.016><c>m </c><00:00:58.384><c>no </c><00:00:58.752><c>no </c><00:00:59.120><c>of </c><00:00:59.488><c>course </c><00:00:59.856><c>I </c><00:01:00.224><c>see </c><00:01:00.592><c>that </c><00:01:00.960><c>the</c>

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
a job m no no of course I see that the
 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.910 align:start position:0%
a job m no no of course I see that the
logical <00:01:01.342><c>thing </c><00:01:01.524><c>would </c><00:01:01.706><c>be </c><00:01:01.888><c>to </c><00:01:02.070><c>charge </c><00:01:02.252><c>for </c><00:01:02.434><c>the </c><00:01:02.616><c>work  </c><00:01:02.798><c>for</c>

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
logical thing would be to charge for the work  for
 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.789 align:start position:0%
logical thing would be to charge for the work  for
