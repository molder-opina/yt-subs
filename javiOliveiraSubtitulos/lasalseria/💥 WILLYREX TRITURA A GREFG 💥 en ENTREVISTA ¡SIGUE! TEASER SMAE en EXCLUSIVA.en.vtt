01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
telling you I think that if Gref
 

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:58.830 align:start position:0%
telling you I think that if Gref
quickly <01:59:54.668><c>accepts </c><01:59:55.336><c>it </c><01:59:56.004><c>is </c><01:59:56.672><c>viable </c><01:59:57.340><c>I </c><01:59:58.008><c>mean </c><01:59:58.676><c>I</c>

quickly accepts it is viable I mean I
 

01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:00.310 align:start position:0%
quickly accepts it is viable I mean I
think <01:59:58.990><c>if </c><01:59:59.140><c>Gref </c><01:59:59.290><c>takes </c><01:59:59.440><c>a </c><01:59:59.590><c>long </c><01:59:59.740><c>time </c><01:59:59.890><c>to </c><02:00:00.040><c>accept</c>

02:00:00.310 --> 02:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
think if Gref takes a long time to accept
 

02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:02.069 align:start position:0%
think if Gref takes a long time to accept

this week gref says you're coming and I think
 

02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:11.990 align:start position:0%
this week gref says you're coming and I think
what <02:00:11.088><c>we </c><02:00:11.256><c>should </c><02:00:11.424><c>do </c><02:00:11.592><c>is </c><02:00:11.760><c>first</c>

02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
what we should do is first
 

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.550 align:start position:0%
what we should do is first
come <02:00:12.319><c>to </c><02:00:12.638><c>gref </c><02:00:12.957><c>an </c><02:00:13.276><c>episode </c><02:00:13.595><c>with </c><02:00:13.914><c>gref </c><02:00:14.233><c>and</c>

come to gref an episode with gref and
 

02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:17.229 align:start position:0%
come to gref an episode with gref and
