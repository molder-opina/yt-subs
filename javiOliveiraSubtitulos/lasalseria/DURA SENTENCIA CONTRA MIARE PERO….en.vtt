00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
dog exists, the dog is identified. In
 

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:13.869 align:start position:0%
dog exists, the dog is identified. In

00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
yes, that the dog is the same.  So, there
 

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:17.589 align:start position:0%
yes, that the dog is the same.  So, there
are <00:08:15.625><c>some </c><00:08:15.931><c>procedural </c><00:08:16.237><c>issues </c><00:08:16.543><c>and </c><00:08:16.849><c>the </c><00:08:17.155><c>sentence</c>

00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
are some procedural issues and the sentence
 

00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:19.869 align:start position:0%
are some procedural issues and the sentence
is <00:08:17.839><c>lighter, </c><00:08:18.079><c>but </c><00:08:18.319><c>the </c><00:08:18.559><c>dog </c><00:08:18.799><c>is </c><00:08:19.039><c>still </c><00:08:19.279><c>there </c><00:08:19.519><c>and </c><00:08:19.759><c>they</c>

is lighter, but the dog is still there and they
 

00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:21.670 align:start position:0%
is lighter, but the dog is still there and they
kept <00:08:20.199><c>it.  </c><00:08:20.519><c>So, </c><00:08:20.839><c>if </c><00:08:21.159><c>it's </c><00:08:21.479><c>not</c>

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
kept it.  So, if it's not
 

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.869 align:start position:0%
kept it.  So, if it's not

00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
one way, it will be another, but it will have to be
 

00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:26.309 align:start position:0%
one way, it will be another, but it will have to be
