01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:41.039 align:start position:0%
say so.  I mean, the first thing I see with Pepa
 

01:00:41.039 --> 01:00:43.710 align:start position:0%
say so.  I mean, the first thing I see with Pepa
is <01:00:41.439><c>that </c><01:00:41.839><c>she </c><01:00:42.239><c>is </c><01:00:42.639><c>capable </c><01:00:43.039><c>of </c><01:00:43.439><c>saying</c>

01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:43.720 align:start position:0%
is that she is capable of saying
 

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.549 align:start position:0%
is that she is capable of saying
something <01:00:43.963><c>like </c><01:00:44.206><c>that, </c><01:00:44.449><c>okay?  </c><01:00:44.692><c>And </c><01:00:44.935><c>the </c><01:00:45.178><c>second </c><01:00:45.421><c>thing </c><01:00:45.664><c>is </c><01:00:45.907><c>that </c><01:00:46.150><c>I </c><01:00:46.393><c>do</c>

01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
something like that, okay?  And the second thing is that I do
 

01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:48.630 align:start position:0%
something like that, okay?  And the second thing is that I do
see <01:00:46.804><c>her </c><01:00:47.049><c>capable </c><01:00:47.294><c>of </c><01:00:47.539><c>denying </c><01:00:47.784><c>it </c><01:00:48.029><c>in </c><01:00:48.274><c>public </c><01:00:48.519><c>and</c>

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
see her capable of denying it in public and
 

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.430 align:start position:0%
see her capable of denying it in public and
then, <01:00:48.849><c>damn, </c><01:00:49.058><c>well </c><01:00:49.267><c>no, </c><01:00:49.476><c>she </c><01:00:49.685><c>hasn't </c><01:00:49.894><c>done </c><01:00:50.103><c>that </c><01:00:50.312><c>with</c>

01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
then, damn, well no, she hasn't done that with
 

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.309 align:start position:0%
then, damn, well no, she hasn't done that with
the <01:00:50.691><c>240, </c><01:00:50.942><c>of </c><01:00:51.193><c>denying </c><01:00:51.444><c>it </c><01:00:51.695><c>in </c><01:00:51.946><c>public </c><01:00:52.197><c>and</c>

01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
the 240, of denying it in public and
 

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:53.950 align:start position:0%
the 240, of denying it in public and
then <01:00:52.520><c>such.</c>

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
then such.
 

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.990 align:start position:0%
then such.
So, <01:00:54.333><c>of </c><01:00:54.706><c>course, </c><01:00:55.079><c>it's </c><01:00:55.452><c>not </c><01:00:55.825><c>something </c><01:00:56.198><c>that's</c>

01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
So, of course, it's not something that's
 

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.470 align:start position:0%
So, of course, it's not something that's
clear, <01:00:57.386><c>but </c><01:00:57.772><c>I </c><01:00:58.158><c>also </c><01:00:58.544><c>think </c><01:00:58.930><c>that </c><01:00:59.316><c>about</c>

01:00:59.470 --> 01:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
clear, but I also think that about
 

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:02.029 align:start position:0%
clear, but I also think that about
all <01:00:59.751><c>of </c><01:01:00.022><c>them, </c><01:01:00.293><c>I </c><01:01:00.564><c>mean, </c><01:01:00.835><c>you, </c><01:01:01.106><c>the </c><01:01:01.377><c>crazy </c><01:01:01.648><c>one, </c><01:01:01.919><c>the</c>
