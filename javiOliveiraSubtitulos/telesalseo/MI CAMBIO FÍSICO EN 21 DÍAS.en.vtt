00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
typical floater, floater,

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:21.380 align:start position:0%
arched, it's an inverted triangle.
 

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.350 align:start position:0%
arched, it's an inverted triangle.
Underneath <00:13:21.846><c>all </c><00:13:22.312><c>that </c><00:13:22.778><c>fat </c><00:13:23.244><c>there </c><00:13:23.710><c>was </c><00:13:24.176><c>an</c>

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
Underneath all that fat there was an
 

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.389 align:start position:0%
Underneath all that fat there was an
abdominal <00:13:24.765><c>wall, </c><00:13:25.170><c>for </c><00:13:25.575><c>example, </c><00:13:25.980><c>important.</c>

evolution. It is a very old part, as I

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:04.500 align:start position:0%

told you, so what it interprets is that

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
nutrients in fewer resources So the

first thing it does is slow down the
