lose and now you file a lawsuit for the

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.550 align:start position:0%

01:14:03.159 --> 01:14:04.510 align:start position:0%

Clear.  Of course, she had a

leaving <01:14:14.156><c>him, </c><01:14:14.352><c>of </c><01:14:14.548><c>course.  </c><01:14:14.744><c>And </c><01:14:14.940><c>on </c><01:14:15.136><c>top </c><01:14:15.332><c>of </c><01:14:15.528><c>that, </c><01:14:15.724><c>he </c><01:14:15.920><c>was</c>

01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
leaving him, of course.  And on top of that, he was
 

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:17.870 align:start position:0%
leaving him, of course.  And on top of that, he was
financially <01:14:16.439><c>dependent </c><01:14:16.598><c>on </c><01:14:16.757><c>her </c><01:14:16.916><c>because </c><01:14:17.075><c>she </c><01:14:17.234><c>was </c><01:14:17.393><c>the </c><01:14:17.552><c>one </c><01:14:17.711><c>who</c>

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
financially dependent on her because she was the one who
 

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.550 align:start position:0%
financially dependent on her because she was the one who
supported <01:14:18.199><c>him </c><01:14:18.518><c>too </c><01:14:18.837><c>and </c><01:14:19.156><c>everything.</c>

01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
supported him too and everything.
 

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:22.590 align:start position:0%
supported him too and everything.
So, <01:14:20.033><c>I </c><01:14:20.506><c>think </c><01:14:20.979><c>he </c><01:14:21.452><c>did </c><01:14:21.925><c>it.  </c><01:14:22.398><c>We</c>

01:14:22.590 --> 01:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
So, I think he did it.  We
 

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.110 align:start position:0%
So, I think he did it.  We
got <01:14:22.968><c>rid </c><01:14:23.336><c>of </c><01:14:23.704><c>this </c><01:14:24.072><c>because </c><01:14:24.440><c>Asunta,</c>

01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
got rid of this because Asunta,
 

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:28.070 align:start position:0%
got rid of this because Asunta,
she <01:14:25.525><c>couldn't </c><01:14:25.930><c>handle </c><01:14:26.335><c>it </c><01:14:26.740><c>anymore. </c><01:14:27.145><c>I </c><01:14:27.550><c>mean, </c><01:14:27.955><c>she</c>

01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
she couldn't handle it anymore. I mean, she
 

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.189 align:start position:0%
she couldn't handle it anymore. I mean, she
wanted <01:14:28.247><c>to </c><01:14:28.414><c>make </c><01:14:28.581><c>her </c><01:14:28.748><c>life </c><01:14:28.915><c>her </c><01:14:29.082><c>own </c><01:14:29.249><c>and </c><01:14:29.416><c>Asunta </c><01:14:29.583><c>was </c><01:14:29.750><c>like </c><01:14:29.917><c>a</c>

01:14:30.189 --> 01:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to make her life her own and Asunta was like a
 

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:33.430 align:start position:0%
wanted to make her life her own and Asunta was like a
burden <01:14:30.599><c>to </c><01:14:30.999><c>her </c><01:14:31.399><c>and </c><01:14:31.799><c>I </c><01:14:32.199><c>think </c><01:14:32.599><c>he</c>

01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
burden to her and I think he
 

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
burden to her and I think he
did <01:14:33.652><c>it </c><01:14:33.864><c>like, </c><01:14:34.076><c>"Okay, </c><01:14:34.288><c>I'll </c><01:14:34.500><c>help </c><01:14:34.712><c>you </c><01:14:34.924><c>so </c><01:14:35.136><c>and </c><01:14:35.348><c>so </c><01:14:35.560><c>and</c>

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
did it like, "Okay, I'll help you so and so and
 

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.390 align:start position:0%
did it like, "Okay, I'll help you so and so and

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
then this secret is what
 

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.790 align:start position:0%
then this secret is what

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:07.149 align:start position:0%

take the benefits because he didn't
 

01:15:07.159 --> 01:15:08.629 align:start position:0%
take the benefits because he didn't

I <01:15:08.920><c>tried.</c>

01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
I tried.
 

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:14.030 align:start position:0%
I tried.

Of course, man, he already died. The revisable didn't
 

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:17.470 align:start position:0%
Of course, man, he already died. The revisable didn't
