00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.710 align:start position:0%
think that what they're criticizing Rocío Carrasco for
 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
think that what they're criticizing Rocío Carrasco for
is <00:07:22.045><c>that </c><00:07:22.380><c>she's </c><00:07:22.715><c>been, </c><00:07:23.050><c>so </c><00:07:23.385><c>to </c><00:07:23.720><c>speak,</c>

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.050 align:start position:0%
is that she's been, so to speak,
 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.370 align:start position:0%
is that she's been, so to speak,

spoiled, but for the complete opposite,
 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.969 align:start position:0%
spoiled, but for the complete opposite,
because <00:07:27.875><c>she's </c><00:07:28.370><c>been </c><00:07:28.865><c>spoiled </c><00:07:29.360><c>too </c><00:07:29.855><c>much, </c><00:07:30.350><c>she's</c>

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:30.979 align:start position:0%
because she's been spoiled too much, she's
 

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:32.860 align:start position:0%
because she's been spoiled too much, she's
been <00:07:31.529><c>too </c><00:07:32.079><c>capricious, </c><00:07:32.629><c>maybe</c>

she's <00:07:33.344><c>had </c><00:07:33.818><c>everything. </c><00:07:34.292><c>Not </c><00:07:34.766><c>that </c><00:07:35.240><c>she's</c>

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
she's had everything. Not that she's
 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.330 align:start position:0%
she's had everything. Not that she's
called <00:07:35.980><c>spoiled </c><00:07:36.600><c>because </c><00:07:37.220><c>she's</c>

called spoiled because she's
 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
called spoiled because she's

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:41.539 align:start position:0%
spoiled, so I think that's
 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:43.300 align:start position:0%
