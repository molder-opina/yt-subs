Ewin is still alive and kills him. With that, it
 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.470 align:start position:0%
Ewin is still alive and kills him. With that, it
could <00:00:20.565><c>be. </c><00:00:20.851><c>We </c><00:00:21.137><c>are </c><00:00:21.423><c>still </c><00:00:21.709><c>clear </c><00:00:21.995><c>that</c>

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
could be. We are still clear that
 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.710 align:start position:0%
could be. We are still clear that
the <00:00:22.748><c>day </c><00:00:23.016><c>before </c><00:00:23.284><c>he </c><00:00:23.552><c>bought </c><00:00:23.820><c>all </c><00:00:24.088><c>the </c><00:00:24.356><c>materials</c>

the day before he bought all the materials
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.710 align:start position:0%
the day before he bought all the materials
that <00:00:24.919><c>he </c><00:00:25.118><c>was </c><00:00:25.317><c>going </c><00:00:25.516><c>to </c><00:00:25.715><c>use </c><00:00:25.914><c>for </c><00:00:26.113><c>this </c><00:00:26.312><c>death, </c><00:00:26.511><c>so</c>

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
that he was going to use for this death, so
 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.109 align:start position:0%
that he was going to use for this death, so
well, <00:00:26.928><c>in </c><00:00:27.136><c>the </c><00:00:27.344><c>end, </c><00:00:27.552><c>I </c><00:00:27.760><c>believe </c><00:00:27.968><c>that </c><00:00:28.176><c>the </c><00:00:28.384><c>cause </c><00:00:28.592><c>of </c><00:00:28.800><c>death</c>

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
well, in the end, I believe that the cause of death
 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.269 align:start position:0%
well, in the end, I believe that the cause of death
was <00:00:29.759><c>judicial. </c><00:00:30.399><c>I </c><00:00:31.039><c>think</c>

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
was judicial. I think
 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
was judicial. I think
that <00:00:31.705><c>absolutely </c><00:00:32.131><c>nothing </c><00:00:32.557><c>changes.</c>
