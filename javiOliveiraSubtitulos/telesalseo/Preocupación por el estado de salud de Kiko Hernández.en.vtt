00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
takes a few months to find the

takes a few months to find the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
real result and that's simply it. Let's see,
 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.350 align:start position:0%
real result and that's simply it. Let's see,
normally <00:01:22.454><c>the </c><00:01:22.948><c>touch-ups </c><00:01:23.442><c>are </c><00:01:23.936><c>to</c>

normally the touch-ups are to
 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.630 align:start position:0%
normally the touch-ups are to
improve, <00:01:24.768><c>not </c><00:01:25.176><c>to </c><00:01:25.584><c>worsen. </c><00:01:25.992><c>So </c><00:01:26.400><c>I</c>

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
improve, not to worsen. So I
 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.270 align:start position:0%
improve, not to worsen. So I
