or they're also going to the wedding or we
 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.370 align:start position:0%
or they're also going to the wedding or we
can't <00:07:50.050><c>because </c><00:07:50.240><c>the </c><00:07:50.430><c>kids </c><00:07:50.620><c>are </c><00:07:50.810><c>coming, </c><00:07:51.000><c>no,</c>

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
can't because the kids are coming, no,
 

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.370 align:start position:0%
can't because the kids are coming, no,
I <00:07:52.534><c>think </c><00:07:52.688><c>that </c><00:07:52.842><c>in </c><00:07:52.996><c>part </c><00:07:53.150><c>it's </c><00:07:53.304><c>that </c><00:07:53.458><c>it</c>

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:54.380 align:start position:0%
I think that in part it's that it
 

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.290 align:start position:0%
I think that in part it's that it
coincided <00:07:55.035><c>with </c><00:07:55.690><c>Marta </c><00:07:56.345><c>being </c><00:07:57.000><c>angry,</c>

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
coincided with Marta being angry,
 

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.870 align:start position:0%
coincided with Marta being angry,
dude, <00:07:57.540><c>risk, </c><00:07:57.780><c>too,</c>

00:07:59.870 --> 00:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
dude, risk, too,
 

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.050 align:start position:0%
dude, risk, too,
so <00:08:00.248><c>it </c><00:08:00.616><c>would </c><00:08:00.984><c>also </c><00:08:01.352><c>make </c><00:08:01.720><c>sense </c><00:08:02.088><c>that </c><00:08:02.456><c>he</c>

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
so it would also make sense that he
 

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.710 align:start position:0%
so it would also make sense that he
fought <00:08:03.720><c>with </c><00:08:04.380><c>Marta, </c><00:08:05.040><c>risk, </c><00:08:05.700><c>he'll </c><00:08:06.360><c>fight</c>

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
fought with Marta, risk, he'll fight
 

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.930 align:start position:0%
fought with Marta, risk, he'll fight
with <00:08:06.977><c>his </c><00:08:07.234><c>girlfriend </c><00:08:07.491><c>and </c><00:08:07.748><c>that's </c><00:08:08.005><c>why </c><00:08:08.262><c>he </c><00:08:08.519><c>didn't</c>

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
with his girlfriend and that's why he didn't
 

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.809 align:start position:0%
with his girlfriend and that's why he didn't
go, <00:08:09.342><c>I </c><00:08:09.744><c>mean, </c><00:08:10.146><c>why </c><00:08:10.548><c>aren't </c><00:08:10.950><c>you </c><00:08:11.352><c>going </c><00:08:11.754><c>to</c>
