Let's see, it could be a hack, but of course, it seems very strange to me that they hacked her and changed her completely because they usually, usually when they hack your account it is usually some cryptocurrency, eh, but of course, from a specific Only Fan user, eh,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
strange to me that it is a hack,
 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.790 align:start position:0%
strange to me that it is a hack,
because <00:04:39.488><c>of </c><00:04:39.816><c>course, </c><00:04:40.144><c>the </c><00:04:40.472><c>verified </c><00:04:40.800><c>symbol,</c>

because of course, the verified symbol,
 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.230 align:start position:0%
because of course, the verified symbol,
when <00:04:42.194><c>you </c><00:04:42.588><c>change </c><00:04:42.982><c>photos </c><00:04:43.376><c>and </c><00:04:43.770><c>so </c><00:04:44.164><c>on, </c><00:04:44.558><c>and</c>

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
when you change photos and so on, and
 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.189 align:start position:0%
when you change photos and so on, and
you <00:04:45.474><c>have </c><00:04:45.708><c>to </c><00:04:45.942><c>verify </c><00:04:46.176><c>again </c><00:04:46.410><c>that </c><00:04:46.644><c>it </c><00:04:46.878><c>is</c>

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
you have to verify again that it is
 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.830 align:start position:0%
you have to verify again that it is
you <00:04:47.495><c>for </c><00:04:47.791><c>them </c><00:04:48.087><c>to </c><00:04:48.383><c>accept </c><00:04:48.679><c>the</c>

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
you for them to accept the
 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.469 align:start position:0%
you for them to accept the
profile <00:04:49.246><c>photo.  </c><00:04:49.652><c>So </c><00:04:50.058><c>if </c><00:04:50.464><c>it </c><00:04:50.870><c>has </c><00:04:51.276><c>the</c>

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
profile photo.  So if it has the
 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.230 align:start position:0%
profile photo.  So if it has the
verified <00:04:51.809><c>sign, </c><00:04:52.139><c>I </c><00:04:52.469><c>think, </c><00:04:52.799><c>I </c><00:04:53.129><c>would </c><00:04:53.459><c>say </c><00:04:53.789><c>it's </c><00:04:54.119><c>not</c>

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
verified sign, I think, I would say it's not
 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.670 align:start position:0%
verified sign, I think, I would say it's not
a <00:04:54.535><c>hack, </c><00:04:54.830><c>right?  </c><00:04:55.125><c>No, </c><00:04:55.420><c>I </c><00:04:55.715><c>would </c><00:04:56.010><c>say </c><00:04:56.305><c>that </c><00:04:56.600><c>he</c>

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 align:start position:0%

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.070 align:start position:0%
