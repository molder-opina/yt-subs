the <00:03:22.820><c>truth </c><00:03:23.080><c>is </c><00:03:23.340><c>that </c><00:03:23.600><c>no </c><00:03:23.860><c>then </c><00:03:24.120><c>because </c><00:03:24.380><c>there </c><00:03:24.640><c>has </c><00:03:24.900><c>not</c>

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 align:start position:0%
the truth is that no then because there has not
 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.290 align:start position:0%
the truth is that no then because there has not
