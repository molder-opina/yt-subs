at that time who would have gone
 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.149 align:start position:0%
at that time who would have gone

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.910 align:start position:0%
home for not tolerating
opposing <00:03:48.425><c>discourse.  </c><00:03:48.691><c>So </c><00:03:48.957><c>that's </c><00:03:49.223><c>what </c><00:03:49.489><c>I </c><00:03:49.755><c>don't</c>

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
opposing discourse.  So that's what I don't
 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.710 align:start position:0%
opposing discourse.  So that's what I don't
quite <00:03:50.479><c>understand.  </c><00:03:51.038><c>Yes, </c><00:03:51.597><c>indeed.  </c><00:03:52.156><c>Clear.</c>

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.550 align:start position:0%
quite understand.  Yes, indeed.  Clear.
So <00:03:53.006><c>it's </c><00:03:53.292><c>true </c><00:03:53.578><c>that </c><00:03:53.864><c>I </c><00:03:54.150><c>wouldn't </c><00:03:54.436><c>have</c>

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
So it's true that I wouldn't have
 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.229 align:start position:0%
So it's true that I wouldn't have
sent <00:03:54.973><c>them </c><00:03:55.386><c>home, </c><00:03:55.799><c>right?</c>

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
sent them home, right?
 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.110 align:start position:0%
sent them home, right?
But <00:03:56.583><c>for </c><00:03:56.927><c>home.  </c><00:03:57.271><c>He </c><00:03:57.615><c>played </c><00:03:57.959><c>for</c>

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
But for home.  He played for
 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.990 align:start position:0%
But for home.  He played for

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
the people's work as he wished.  Clear.  That is.
 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.830 align:start position:0%
the people's work as he wished.  Clear.  That is.
So <00:04:00.215><c>I </c><00:04:00.430><c>don't </c><00:04:00.645><c>like </c><00:04:00.860><c>seeing </c><00:04:01.075><c>her </c><00:04:01.290><c>like </c><00:04:01.505><c>that, </c><00:04:01.720><c>I'm</c>

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
So I don't like seeing her like that, I'm
 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.509 align:start position:0%
So I don't like seeing her like that, I'm

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.149 align:start position:0%
