00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.030 align:start position:0%
okay And it is what it is Because that's what you  I
mean, <00:03:30.768><c>they're </c><00:03:30.996><c>not </c><00:03:31.224><c>like </c><00:03:31.452><c>private </c><00:03:31.680><c>companies</c>

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 align:start position:0%

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 align:start position:0%

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.890 align:start position:0%

she <00:03:37.535><c>will </c><00:03:38.051><c>basically </c><00:03:38.567><c>have </c><00:03:39.083><c>a </c><00:03:39.599><c>stipulated</c>

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
