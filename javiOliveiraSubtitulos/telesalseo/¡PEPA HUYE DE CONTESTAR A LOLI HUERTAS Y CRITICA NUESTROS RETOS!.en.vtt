00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
going to receive an inheritance or has one pending, what does that have to
 

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.630 align:start position:0%
going to receive an inheritance or has one pending, what does that have to
do <00:24:03.746><c>with </c><00:24:04.092><c>it, </c><00:24:04.438><c>right?</c>

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
do with it, right?
 

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.830 align:start position:0%
do with it, right?
Because <00:24:04.946><c>the </c><00:24:05.252><c>inheritance </c><00:24:05.558><c>belongs </c><00:24:05.864><c>to </c><00:24:06.170><c>the </c><00:24:06.476><c>mother,</c>

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
Because the inheritance belongs to the mother,
 

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.470 align:start position:0%
Because the inheritance belongs to the mother,
so <00:24:07.136><c>the </c><00:24:07.432><c>inheritance </c><00:24:07.728><c>from </c><00:24:08.024><c>the </c><00:24:08.320><c>mother</c>

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
so the inheritance from the mother
 

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.909 align:start position:0%
so the inheritance from the mother
has <00:24:08.657><c>to </c><00:24:08.834><c>be </c><00:24:09.011><c>shared </c><00:24:09.188><c>equally </c><00:24:09.365><c>among </c><00:24:09.542><c>the </c><00:24:09.719><c>three</c>

00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
has to be shared equally among the three
 

00:24:09.919 --> 00:24:12.029 align:start position:0%
has to be shared equally among the three
children, <00:24:10.303><c>right?  </c><00:24:10.687><c>Now, </c><00:24:11.071><c>then </c><00:24:11.455><c>each </c><00:24:11.839><c>one</c>

00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:12.039 align:start position:0%
children, right?  Now, then each one
 

00:24:12.039 --> 00:24:13.510 align:start position:0%
children, right?  Now, then each one
has <00:24:12.225><c>his </c><00:24:12.411><c>father </c><00:24:12.597><c>and </c><00:24:12.783><c>has </c><00:24:12.969><c>other </c><00:24:13.155><c>inheritances</c>

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%

00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
