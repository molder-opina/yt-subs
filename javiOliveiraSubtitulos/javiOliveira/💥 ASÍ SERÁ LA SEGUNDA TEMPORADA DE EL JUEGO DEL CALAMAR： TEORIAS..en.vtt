00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 align:start position:0%
keys to the success of the series then what
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.580 align:start position:0%
keys to the success of the series then what
is <00:02:38.943><c>the </c><00:02:39.156><c>plot </c><00:02:39.369><c>the </c><00:02:39.582><c>surprise </c><00:02:39.795><c>of </c><00:02:40.008><c>the </c><00:02:40.221><c>end </c><00:02:40.434><c>and</c>

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 align:start position:0%
is the plot the surprise of the end and
 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
is the plot the surprise of the end and
so <00:02:40.737><c>on, </c><00:02:40.884><c>well </c><00:02:41.031><c>it </c><00:02:41.178><c>seems </c><00:02:41.325><c>to </c><00:02:41.472><c>me </c><00:02:41.619><c>that </c><00:02:41.766><c>they </c><00:02:41.913><c>could </c><00:02:42.060><c>have</c>

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 align:start position:0%
so on, well it seems to me that they could have
 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.820 align:start position:0%
so on, well it seems to me that they could have
put <00:02:42.345><c>those </c><00:02:42.480><c>as </c><00:02:42.615><c>if </c><00:02:42.750><c>they </c><00:02:42.885><c>had </c><00:02:43.020><c>been </c><00:02:43.155><c>any </c><00:02:43.290><c>other</c>
