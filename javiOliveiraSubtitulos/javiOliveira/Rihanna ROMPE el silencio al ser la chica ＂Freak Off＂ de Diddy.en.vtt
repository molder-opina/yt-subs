00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.880
Sometimes I ask myself and I have my doubt, no, and that is that on the one hand, the human being is supposed to be

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.480
the most intelligent animal that exists, not the living being, but nevertheless we are always the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.640
most capable of complicating our lives. Notice that the most logical it would be if you make a mistake

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.120
if you commit an illegal act Better said that you cannot or that you should not have committed and yet

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.840
you leave Rosita and nothing has happened to you And well, look, it turned out well on

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.960
this occasion, don't be afraid lashed, don't do it anymore, the logical thing would be the most sensible thing to say: Well,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.120
look, this time I've done it, they haven't lashed me for adante, I won't do it anymore, lest I

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.920
won't have the same luck next time, but nevertheless these types of characters Normally, no, they don't

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.360
act like that. Normally, when you do something over and over again and over and over again and each time with more

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.360
impunity and you feel more empowered, what you do is break down by believing yourself or seeing that there are no

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.120
consequences and having no limits. And it is We cannot deny that Didi has camped freely

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.560
for three decades doing whatever he wanted and has come to consider himself

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.640
unstoppable. In fact there are videos of him shouting that he could be whatever he wanted, that he was

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.800
Untouchable and practically what we are seeing and I am confirming this opinion more and more

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:29.920
as the days go by that the Untouchable has been hit and I think it has also sunk

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:51.880
next staying Stay ling do Man What's next Give Me the do we will all agree that

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.800
things are getting worse complicating and it does not look good at all, especially considering that more and more people

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.480
are coming out to talk, although it is true that some Hollywood stars, which is what

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.880
we will see in this video, continue to keep their mouths shut, but there are more than 100 victims who are

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.440
denouncing now officially and when I say officially it is because pay attention to this data that is not

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.080
mentioned much, there are more than 3,000 victims, only those who have gone to a law firm to report

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.200
the situation, what happens is that they have wanted to summarize No And they have practically chosen the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.840
clearest cases not that can be fought in a court I also tell you if a person already has

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.080
so many complaints then I don't think that in his life it will change more 100 200 more look what

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.320
we are talking about eh And We are talking about the fact that neither money nor power nor contacts, no matter how many

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.880
agreements he has tried to offer to the judges, do not bring him out of the shadows. What's up, my kids?

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.040
How are you? I hope you are having a great weekend. Here we are another day with

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.280
a little video. new about the Didi case, remind you that we have a playlist in which

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.920
we are covering the topic every day Or every time I have an update

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.080
We have some news for a while, okay, this topic still needs to be talked about, in fact, I'm going to make this video

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.280
divide it into two and you are going to have this one and another one tomorrow or in the next few hours So subscribe,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:29.760
activate the bell and if you like it and are interested in this type of content, don't even blink, get comfortable,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.120
the next click that I am going to put on the screen is brutal And suddenly in

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.240
a joint interview with Justin Bieber Justin is commenting on the gifts that

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.160
Didi gives him and then things he does with him and pay attention to this detail,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.280
pay attention to this moment in which Didi cuts him off so that he does not continue telling more

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:06.040
things Friends in a strange way you know Yeah yeah It's like exactly I'm Bing yeah no I mean

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.000
I mean He's I mean to a lot of Us He's like aa little brother you know what I'm saying

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.880
He's not afraid to call and Ask for He's Somebody That in the Industry wise the

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.040
record Industry is a strong family and He's Somebody That you know We definitely have Our

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.040
Arms around and We want to protect him Because He's such a genuinely Nice person besides his

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.200
Talent you know saying He's One of the greatest Kids that you could Ever know you know did he

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.720
bought son of benty Maybe you know he could Buy You One also Lamborghini That's nice

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.000
weird truth But well, we are going to leave the topic of Justin Bieber a little paused

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.760
in this video because I wanted to talk to you about other stars like for example rihana or

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.240
bon who are quite linked to this case and have tried to tiptoe around but

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.800
in this case in the last few days we have seen how rihana responded in some way to their

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.200
involvement and participation in the peace party Dad Rihana has broken her silence or we could

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.000
say something similar, one of the most listened to artists of the 31st century and to whom Didi even

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.480
organized parties especially for her, one in an after-party after a delivery

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.680
of Prize, they are quite popular parties, okay Yes, it is true that it was a bit strange

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.120
because they are still Didi parties or parties of the brands that paid Didi

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.400
universal gramis but that asked Didi to organize what happens on this occasion Well

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.560
They used Rihana or other artists as the name of After. I understand why they are more striking.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.800
For this reason, Rihana and Didi met on several occasions and we can say that

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:55.800
[Music] they knew each other. And the power that Didi had in the industry was so great that

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.840
There were many and not all of them who wanted to get close to him, to be in the environment

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.640
around him, to talk to him. In fact, it was quite common for there to be

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:11.720
fights about Didi and the topic of contacts at any of these awards galas and so on,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.040
and always, always. It always didn't fail whoever was sitting next to Didi, that was the

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.920
star of the night, as I was telling you, in some way, Rihana seems to have broken her

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.000
silence. I don't know if that's the most that can be gotten out of her, but when she left a nightclub in her Barbados native country

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.640
was asked by a papari in the first instance because he had

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.080
a slightly uncomfortable look as if he didn't know what to answer And so on But in the end he made a

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:45.160
feint the question directly It was about If he was in the Freak which let's say are the strong parts of

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:52.160
Didi's parties and she said something like she's crazy, it's not crazy. Although it is

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.200
true that this answer could be misinterpreted, I don't know what you think and it doesn't make it clear to us if

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.320
she is talking about the question being crazy. that obviously she has never been to something

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.120
like that Or that the parties were crazy or that the question itself was crazy So yes, it is

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.830
true that the answer is a bit short, no And it leaves the door a little open there to [Music ]

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:21.840
[Applause]
interpretation and well, although it is undoubtedly a fairly short answer, it is one of the few

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.120
answers that have been obtained from some stars of this magnitude because there are

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.200
other examples such as billion yes or her husband j Yes, Didi's best friend Apparently

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.160
they don't get involved in the subject and are currently being tremendously fun on their

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.120
social networks. Apart from being a friend of Didi, he is a quite impressive rapper, in fact, I

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.200
would say that he is much more impressive than Didi himself when it comes to generating With respect, there are even

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.320
people who point out that he is even worse than Didi and apparently both he and Villon s

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.320
Well, having this closeness with Didi Well, they are being pointed out a lot because it would be assumed

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.600
that they would be quite involved or that at least they would know many things. things for JC's part, despite

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.200
being a star of enormous size, he is not usually active on social networks.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.000
Well, in fact, he is completely missing, he is always not active, okay, he is

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.720
never participating in social networks and that in part because it generates that in internet at least you go

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.160
too unnoticed But he is in charge and has responsibilities for enormous things, he is

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:25.640
the producer of the shows in the middle of the super bow, that is, he is responsible for choosing the artist who

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.240
is going to perform in front of approximately 200 million people, therefore I think you can

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.840
get an idea of ​​the power it has within the industry. Unlike billion, yes, this one

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:40.440
has lost a little more than a million followers on his Instagram account and you will say Wow, he has

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.240
lost a million followers. Well, The best thing is that she doesn't care a little considering that

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:50.440
she has 315 million followers, okay, before she had 316, my God, I think they're not going to go

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.800
bankrupt yet, but the fun they're putting these two on social media is brutal

00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.360
. global trend for more than 48 hours and right now everyone is itching for a bad

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.920
petard

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:23.920
to compromise not when it comes to speaking out or not JC was responsible for getting

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.200
Rihana into the music industry He met her because he heard her sing

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.440
when she was 16 years and here there is a bit strange episode not having everything now

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.280
the context that we have today to know that this man found her when she was 16

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.920
years old, apparently he met her in his office, we are talking about the year 2006 2005. And

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.120
they spent many hours until 3 in the morning in the office talking and for seen JC literally told her

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:59.480
something like I'm not going to let her leave until she signs the contract [Music]

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.720
you come in contact with her I mean did you Fly over there J Brown actually bought me

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.960
song She a song right now I say massive Because When I First heard the song and

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.000
then you know he kept going J Brown he kept Being persistent I was like you know bring

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.480
her by and When She walked in Our Office I was like you know She Just Had It was

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:20.400
Just about was She Had was about and then She performed the song And I was like Okay

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.280
okay then you know we sat down and we Talk and She would Stay in the Studio and try to

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.320
get the look over then Come Back the next day I was like Oh work and Everything Is there so we

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.720
but if you hear it from Rihana's mouth the version is even stronger the weirder

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.360
let's call it weirder He told me there are two ways to get out of here go out the

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:59.560
door with the signed contract or go out the window and We are on the 29th floor

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.960
, which obviously at this moment and in this context in which he is telling it, it is supposed

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.080
to be to give it some humor, not as a joke, etc. But of course, right now the oven

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:13.080
is not working, this situation was quite common. between Didi JC and every time they found and married

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.440
talents, let's say remember the story with one's own, almost, for example, well, remembering the

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.600
story with one's own, almost in fact, it makes it even more murky, what an example But well,

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:26.640
on the one hand, and relating Rihana to JC and others, note, for example, that you know the

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.920
well-known episode of abuse that Rihana suffered from Chris Brown, who was convicted. In fact,

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:38.400
not that this guy. By the way, he recently came out to point out that it is good that she is not innocent in

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:43.480
the matter of the involvement that she had in the Dadi peace party but Eh well she was

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:49.360
being manipulated it's like they want to blame her but she did participate quite a bit in those parties

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.040
but it was because she was manipulated so I don't understand why La Movida points her out The thing is that

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.640
by the time that episode of abuse happened, we are talking about the first time that Chris

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:02.880
Brown and Rihanna had a relationship. It is said that JC was in love with Rihana when she was 17 and

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.440
he was 36. If at first she made Chris Brown's life impossible because She wasn't amused by

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:13.440
his courtship with her, the fact that you mistreat her. Well, that was the end. Jz told her, of course, I

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.480
'm going to ruin your career. Well, in reality, not only did he tell her that he was going to ruin her career,

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.720
he really did. I wanted to get it out of the way by speaking clearly or at least Chris Brown has been

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.880
saying that he understood it like this basically that he was a man I can't say it

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.520
clearly on YouTube but you already understood me he was very very very angry And rightly so because of the episode

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.320
of abuse from Chris Brown to Rihana, it's the end of your career, I'm going to make sure you never

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.600
set foot on stage again, let's go, and that's how the other one was, not that he was very afraid of him either

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.040
, and he said things like this that you're seeing on the screen. about JC, stop the video if you want to read it

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.360
because I think YouTube would be a little silly if I read it but it's true that of course Eh well

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.080
the main person responsible rihana forgave him having been convicted you already know that rihana forgave

00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:00.320
Chris Brown she had a relationship with him again him and this made Didi and Kenji West get

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:08.200
Chris Brown back into the industry a little crazy but that's how it was This is something that [Music]

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:15.200
good but well that we were doing very well JC condemning Chris Brown for the issue of the abuse

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:21.160
of rihana But why hasn't nimu said about the issue of his friend Didi with almost the fact that we have already seen

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.880
the entire video of how he beats her up and not at 18 but at 47 and the same with billion as in

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.480
These 6 months since we had that viral clip, not the security cameras of the hotel where

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.000
we all saw it, because it continues in silence, there is a theory And what is thought is that, for

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.640
example, people like Riana, having participated and having been involved, were manipulated or not

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.640
in all the shenanigans or in some illegal thing that could have been done within

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.920
the party that these people had blackmailed him and that it was better for him to remain silent, something that would

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.480
actually make some sense Because if the guy is going to be condemned for both justice

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.640
, or at least it looks like society, why do you get off? Get yourself into an

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.880
unnecessary problem that is not going to contribute anything, no, and you take it and save your ass. What

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:09.520
's happening is obviously yes. It's true that if you don't speak up, never speak up, in

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.440
any case, it's not fun for this couple JC bonc, in case silence specifically with Didi, they have come up

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.720
with quite crazy theories, not only the issue of blackmail as I was currently telling you,

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:25.760
but they are coming even to theorize that when Kenji West went up to humiliate Taylor Swis

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:30.440
in that very famous episode that we have discussed in previous videos that he did it on purpose to

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:35.080
save her, that is, so that in some way, this is crazy [ __ ], the truth is That seems like a tremendous smoke of a joint to me.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.200
I

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.160
think that was something that at the time seemed like a good idea

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:59.040
to Kenji West. and that she was not close to Didi's circle

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.120
[Applause]

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.800
I sincerely agree more with what the singer Haard has said

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.960
, who is usually quite critical of the Hollywood figure who is covering this up and that is that

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.920
she From a television show The BBC has directly pointed out Billion

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.000
Se and her partner because apparently it has information from people who have

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.160
contacted her and would affirm that these people have a lot of things to hide

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.040
and that they would not be interested in. If they came out they talk about kidnappings and worse things. I won't. to

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:42.240
mention to give testimony about not only What Mr Carter has done to them but his wife

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.480
as well they're a Nasty Little couple they do Nasty things What do you think happen

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:52.400
with keeping people Against their Will putting people on plans While they're

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:58.920
unconscious unc

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:08.680
Listen I said Jon not here unfortunately to respond that H with you little eye eh talking about

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:14.040
putting people on planes involuntarily obviously I believe that the presumption of

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.920
innocence is something that always has to be respected but in the case of Didi, I believe that his

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.360
actions became something flagrant and that the things that were said about him acquired a certain

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.160
veracity at the moment in which that video was leaked in that hotel hitting the almost

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.840
super violent way and we are talking about Very few people from the elite world are coming out to

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:42.760
condemn other people and supposed flags not against him abuse I move my you

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.960
people like opra good thing you have a series on the channel on the subject of Michael Jackson and

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.480
how this woman stabbed him Michael with false accusations and then nevertheless his

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.800
name is appearing everywhere, for example in Jeffrey Epstein's lists, he appeared in the

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:00.320
Pididi case, this woman is also being mentioned a lot and she has never spoken out against

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.600
them, the two candidates for The presidency of the United States are accusing each other

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:09.080
of having been at Didi's parties and few people are being forceful and Clarita with

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:14.280
this case without fear of losing that is why we thank people like fiten who are being very applauded

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.920
and you will see when Take out the documentary, the one that's going to get involved or people like Kesha, who you already know

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:25.200
had a cameo in her hit TikTok, had a little reference to Didi and

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.120
the song has been re-recorded to replace it and that replaces the previous mention so that Didi doesn't have that

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:39.360
[Applause]

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:52.640
wink and another who has also taken a step forward has been Lady Gaga and the moment

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.360
she found out that the law firm she works with there was a possibility that it would be the one

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:05.040
you hire to defend yourself. Lady Gaga has come out to tell her law firm if you are going to defend Didi, I will

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.840
stop working with you. Lady Gaga has always stayed away from Pat Dadi. In reality, she

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.880
has never been related to him because although many are doing so, it is actually

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:19.520
something that is surprising. that it was an open secret what was happening at that party, childish rumors

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:25.160
trafficking of minors in 2019 when the accusations came out against rapper R Kelly, a friend of

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.960
Didi, what's cool, that man secretly married a 15-year-old girl and started recording

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.200
videos with her, a little well, anyway, I'm not going to go into detail but now he is sentenced to

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:39.600
30 years in prison and at that time Lady Gaga was one of the few to come out and condemn that guy

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.920
when many people did not dare to even condemn herself and apologize to the public

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.160
for having collaborated with him in the past and good with respect to what I was telling you that the

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:54.040
law firm has decided not to defend Didi, they have alleged that it was their own decision But well

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.880
, they have not denied either that the request by Lady Gaga has been there to see the final end

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:05.440
This good, lawyers have their job and many times it is common Eh, well, seeing lawyers who

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.720
defend criminals, in fact, normally you do have to have lawyers because they report you

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.640
because they sue you because you have gotten into trouble, no, and they have to defend you You may be the

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.720
culprit Or it may be the person you are denouncing but the lawyers have to do

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.480
their job and they are there, not even many times when they are cases of criminals, even murderers.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.640
Well, you have no choice but to defend them, not because that is the job. There is no better

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.000
But hey, I perfectly understand Lady Gaga's point of not wanting to share a law firm

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.440
and not being related in some way, even indirectly, to these people. Although listen to me, well,

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.560
the editor will be posting some photos for you here. Although very censored. okay because they are

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:44.200
very shady photos And I don't put my hand in the fire for Lady Kaga either because she is a little

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.960
too extroverted no And she has also attended other elite parties that are not Didi's

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.440
but that are also quite strange nowadays Today I am grateful that I dedicate myself to YouTube and that

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.080
I haven't taken up singing because I don't know what I would do at those parties, the truth is, bathing, I

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.400
know how, bathing in those pools where there are naked people full of I don't know if it's apple blood,

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.200
I don't even have [ __ ] idea but since it's censored you won't have it either. Adele is also

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.120
someone who has never been related to Didi's parties And it's good that she is British

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.960
and lives in England because she has practically never been although you already know that for example We have

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.880
seen the case of the carcasi that some of them traveled to attend this party

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:23.160
and they have also appeared in their series and so on and apparently, according to what they say, this girl is fearing

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.680
for her life because I don't know, it means that she is terrified because There are rumors that

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.280
they told her something and that she knows something or something like that. I don't know. The truth is that this is very strange. That's why I also

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.120
understand the fear that many people have in this case, even though it is said that when she keeps quiet about you, she could

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.520
be an accomplice. I understand. that in some cases it is out of fear and not to get into trouble purely because they don't go

00:20:41.520 --> 00:21:02.480
with you This video that I have posted Although it seems that it was something emotional or that it was supposed to be

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.960
done, there are people who interpret it as being terrified and not wanting to accept the award

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.920
villon doesn't want to take it off Yes then we have Denzel Washington that many people in the

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.560
previous videos when I was surprised to see him involved in some way having attended a

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:20.840
party you put me in the comments like Javi you don't know Denzel so I don't see the things

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.360
that Sincerely, I have to inform myself about those things that you have put in the

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.720
comments box and maybe we will make a video talking about the subject if you want. I don't know how to ask for it but

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.160
the truth is that he is one of the people who has confronted Didi and We stayed with

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.120
him once. You know that in the previous video we were commenting that he said that he did attend

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.880
Didi's parties but that at the moment he put on the thing that was like something not there

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.600
was like a moment in The one who had to leave apparently the signal was so that you would notice

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:51.120
that some of Didi's guests were beginning to take off their shirts And then there you

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:58.640
were already saying here it's over my my party no and you were leaving but apparently according to a source reported to this

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:06.080
media outlet Us wli in 2003 there was a party that Dendel Washington attended with his wife and he ended up

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:11.040
getting angry and yelling at Didi you don't respect anyone because apparently well being there

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.720
with his wife Well, they saw something they didn't like, too, in Washington, who according to a source

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:22.040
cited by Us Weekly was involved in a heated confrontation with him, you don't respect anyone, said

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:28.560
the actor, shouting before leaving a party he had attended with his wife in the In 2003,

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:34.600
both he and Pauleta, his wife, had been partying until dawn, they saw something and came out

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:40.120
furious, he added this testimony and well, family, hey, I'm going to leave the video here but

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.760
I'm going to immediately record another one so that you can have it in the next few hours. So I want you to be very active

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.240
in the comment box and tell me what's going on with this, no. So what do you think? I would keep quiet about

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:53.320
something like that, empathize with the people who are in high places and they know many things that they have

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:59.400
to keep quiet about, either for fear of their integrity or so that they do not close it well although

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.720
many are also because they are afraid because they have things to keep quiet We have already seen it but we will be

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.960
happy to read you in the comments box you will know in the next few hours another video from

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:24.040
this series subscribe activate the bell and all those things a kiss family bye bye bye
