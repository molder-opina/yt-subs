00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.440
Let's see family, what I am going to do at the beginning of this video is something that I don't really like

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.600
to do because I love that you are the ones who decide whether or not it is worth continuing

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.520
Enjoying a video and watching it completely or leaving it halfway because It will bore you but on

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.880
this occasion I have to warn you that as you have seen, we have been in the last few hours

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.960
without uploading content to this channel because we have been very busy compiling all the information that

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.880
we are going to send in this video. This video is going to have you completely You are going to be amazed by

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.080
the information that we are going to give in this video. I literally think that you are going to be without blinking and

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.160
you are going to be very attentive to everything that is going to come out. Here we are even talking about the fact that he has just been

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.280
accused of sexual abuse. to John Travolta himself In other words, the movie in gray is one of my

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.480
favorite movies, as you can see, my hairstyle is a little inspired by that saga and I have just been

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.280
completely disappointed, of course. Always with the presumption of innocence ahead, but I am

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.160
really freaking out with this one. issue of accusations and the names of actors that are flying

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.040
after the publication of this documentary, but well, to what I was going to do in this video,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.440
yes, I'm going to do it and I'm going to ask you all to stay until the end. I have to stay until

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.240
the end because I'm going to tell you something about a new multi-account on Twitter that has come from

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.080
Amanda Bines herself that completely exposes other content creators to other

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.120
Hollywood actors and even explains what she does every day. Today he points out to speak directly to his

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.120
legal guardians and explains why he has not participated in this documentary that is giving so much to talk about so

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.480
without a doubt stay until the end of the video but don't get lost along the way

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.880

because then I can also use it to add it to this series about everything we are going to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.720
comment on we are going to give some updates on everything that is passing actions of some

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.760
actors and new data about the alleged abuses on Nickelodeon, I have several videos left to record

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.320
on this topic but thank you very much for the support you are giving to these

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.720
videos, the truth is that it is a pleasure to work for you. I am Javi Oliveira, welcome. one

you will also find me verified I will facilitate one thing that I am going to tell you and I'm not saying this because of

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.920
spam But this is very important so that the voice of these people is not forgotten and these cases

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.080
are not silenced that you share the video that you click on the like button all those things so that

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.960
the video gains a lot of diffusion we are speaking that there are few channels in Spanish that are dealing with

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.680
this topic and your help would be important, everything in our power so that people

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.640
are informed is good, I wanted to start with a topic that you have asked me a lot in the comment box

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.520
and it is about the theme of the song and the video clip that Drake Bell released just at the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.480
time this documentary was released. Let's see, we are going to comment on the video clip but with a

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.640
broad brush. I still think a little about what I have said in previous videos. And it seems to me very coincidental

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.920
this staging of Drake Bell participating in the documentary and relating all the time

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.600
what happened to him, the abuse he experienced as a child and the condemnation of that pedophile Briam Pck with all the

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.800
blunders that he has done once as an adult to Let's see if it is true that I do not like to judge

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.920
people who have gone through this because we do not know What type of trauma What type of

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.720
mental problems you may have that can make you react in an even aggressive way

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.440
but it is true that I notice a certain intensity and a certain desperation to link

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.000
through [__] what happened to him as a child to the mistakes he made as an adult, the issue of the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.440
car accident and the issue of having contacted minors and having had inappropriate conversations with them.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.680
Being the adult in a way, I don't know if you will agree with me, let me know in the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.960
comments box, please I want your feedback, but all this and the way he is

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.640
doing things seems to me to be a way to take advantage of what happened to him. as a child to

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.240
justify And in some way that we forgive what he has done as an adult that it is true that he

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.320
has not had carnal contact that it has not amounted to abuse, rape or anything like that

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.320
but that it is something Quite reprehensible Well In fact, I refer to the facts not only

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.040
that he has spoken in the documentary to contribute his version on the subject and that the truth be known, but

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.440
that he has taken advantage of the virality of this same thing at the moment to release his video clip and is

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.480
implying who returns to his career as an actor in one of the scenes we see how

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:39.200
someone who is dressed like Brian Pck picks up a child who is reviewing a script and puts him in his

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:48.280
dressing room and it seems that there is something shady here everything would indicate

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.600
that this would be a representation of that murky episode in his life that he just told us,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.840
as I was telling you, he has also, of course, made

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.160
a recreation of the accident with the car that he had due to

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:14.520
speeding, representing how the paparas dealt with the issue by taking photographs of him

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.800
when he was in this state of shocked and seriously

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:25.080
injured, even parodying the famous photograph that went so viral

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.640
of Drake on the stretcher bleeding from the mouth after the accident.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.440
Later we see how he is supposed to interpret himself going to

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:51.360
rehabilitation and bringing with it a great change in his

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:59.640
life .

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.880
And then we see what is evidently a recreation of the Drake an

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.280
Jos filming set but with some significant changes that have a reason, such as the change here of

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.360
the Mexican flag when the original set had the United States flag, this means

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.000
and represents all these years that he has been living in Mexico and left the United States to

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
go live there, in fact at the end of the video clip he leaves this room to end the video

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
with a scene in which we see him going towards what appears to be a plane taking off something

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.120
that obviously wants to represent us, most likely okay. I understand it, so he returns

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.240
to the United States to resume his career as an actor. In fact, by taking a look at his

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:52.680
Tiktok account, we can see that his content in Yes, he does it in Spanish. to take my

00:06:52.680 --> 00:07:00.600
five favorite ZacarÃ­as we are in Claren Panda's Original golden straws from 190 I am in

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:07.120
the countries here we are in the original tajos of the bike I am on the bike in satellite They have

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.520
a variety of delicious stews I am trying something sweet they gave me a very Mexican one with strawberries

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.920
and cream. Wow, I really loved it. He speaks perfect Spanish and usually attends miang gr with a

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.560
fan of the program accompanied by dubbing actors like Lalo Garsa, who is in charge of giving

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:30.360
Jos a Spanish voice in the very famous series. from Nickelodeon Drake and Jos when you don't want to be

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:43.880
recognized I'm not I'm chitos and I'm Alvin yakitori Really seriously sorry for the access AB

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.760
Hug me By the way apart from this song it is true that this song is giving more than

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.200
talk precisely because What I am telling you because this song was released on purpose.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.000
To take advantage of the virality of the documentary, he previously had another one where he also talks about

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.200
these issues and talks about aspects that he has gone through in his life, perhaps not as directly as now,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.920
not what I think it is. A clear allusion is not playing with a double meaning or anything like that.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.640
And in these old songs it is true that he focused more on his depression,

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.680
on his state of mental health, practically on how badly he had been having it in his youth.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.400
But I'm already telling you, obviously, without withdrawing support for what happened to him when he was little, that

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.160
there is a sentence, there is a person who has served that sentence. Although later Disney

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.600
hired him again, but what happened to him, what happened is not supposedly or allegedly or anything

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.080
like that, we have confirmed it very well, he is a victim, it does not take away the fact that now I don't

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.880
know if he has changed the advice or something like that, but here in my opinion it is clear

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.240
how he wants to use this now to clean up his image for some past mistakes and use

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:52.680
this is a springboard To return to fame devon work haer Let's see I'll give you a little context devon is the

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:58.800
actor who in his childhood starred in a series called the net manual he played

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.120
net that is to say the protagonist this was a series basically in the same style as all

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.240
the ones we are discussing in these videos, it was broadcast between 2004 and 2007, coinciding in these

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.920
years with some series by dan sneider but with other directors and other different producers,

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.640
it was a series that has had its controversies but due to the issue of the personal lives outside

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.680
the set well or inside the set but behind the camera with their actors But not because of the same

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.480
type of controversies that the people who were related to Dan have gone through, that is, in

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.800
these filmings of this series, it did not happen nothing shady with pedophile people, abusive people or

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:38.600
weird people, but there were a lot of controversies among the teenagers, there were shipments between them.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.680
It seems that the actors who were teenagers outside of the role of the series they were involved in had

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.640
sexual encounters, in fact recently this same actor along with another actress who played another

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.120
of the protagonists of the series Jennifer who in fact there was like a sipeo not what we call today

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.320
a shipeo between the two not between Dan and Jennifer Well, they have confirmed that they had meetings

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.160
and that in the end everything They took that chiping further in

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:27.000
real life. I imagine you will agree, but with these things that happened between them, we

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
are not talking about relationships between adults and minors, but rather we are talking about relationships

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.600
between them, so well, just recently here in Spain the actors of the physical or chemical series

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.120
that we could Well Yes I think you could say that it would be more

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.400
or less an equivalent Well an equivalent not so white because Disney was not behind it but

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.000
it was a series about Spanish teenagers who recognized resistance in the program

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.840
Well, things happened between them, so well, I imagine that they are things of nature and that's it,

00:10:53.840 --> 00:11:00.120
we had a great time, we were brothers, that is, it was one, a little bit, this brother, we haven't started,

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.640
brother, brothers, neither, brother, no, because between brothers you can't do certain things,

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.840
those guys don't stop if you weren't there, if you didn't come, none of them, the walls were made of

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:15.720
cardboard in the dressing rooms, nothing happened, but you know, I think you could hear everything in the dressing rooms,

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.600
nothing ever happened, not even once did they call, not even once. Well of course not because there was never any [ __ ] you weren't

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:26.840
doing it separately Exactly Well, to what I was going, the topic is leaving us. It turns out that this

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.800
actor from his tiktok account was joking and making fun of Drake's confession and came to

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:39.040
say the following Let's say as if imitating the voice of an adult man speaking to a child Daniel

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:45.720
we are not supposed to talk that Daniel Go to your hole and give me your hole that is to say the

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:51.520
unfortunate comment not the following The [ __ ] completely were working tremendously on

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.720
social networks and it's no wonder that it crossed your mind. I don't know if you were

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.600
still involved in your role from the 2005 series, even Drake Bell, which I just realized.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.800
By the way, it has in its Twitter eth, that's because of the ethereum, that is, the guy is involved in the

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:11.160
cryptocurrency thing, also well, anyway, another topic Drake Bell was offended, that is, he posted this tweet

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.440
saying seriously, you did this, guy, seriously, you made this joke, devon, well finally he

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:21.360
had no choice but to apologize he was being an idiot today there is no way around it I feel horrible

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:28.240
that my idiot self was talking about this without seeing it I watched K on setet the documentary tonight and

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.960
I am horrified by the severity of what Drake and others They shared really heartbroken about what

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:39.680
my fellow actors went through I can't believe they weren't protected I'm sorry for aggravating the

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.440
pain well apologies apologizing is always okay I've always said no If a person

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.360
apologizes that there's nothing more they can do I mean now You can't do more than apologize. Hey, look,

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.000
I'm going to cut off my hand for you, not so that you can forgive me. Let's see, he apologized. But this thing about

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.320
him not being aware and needing to watch the series, I highly doubt it. We're talking about

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.400
That's good, because this topic is already being talked about, that is, this topic was being talked about, now more information is known, now it is known.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.920
They know more information but this topic was talked about if it was talked about among the public and people, more or

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:12.960
less, already in networks, the actors talked about it. That is, the people related to the world of the series,

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:18.600
no and of and more about this Niche knew things. I mean, you're telling me that one of the main actors

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:24.440
who worked at Nickelodion didn't know anything, I don't believe it in any other order of things, these two actors

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.880
who are here are two actors from the series i Carly I mean that i Carly I know that You

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.960
laughed a lot at me but I say it like the iPhone there is Carly no and Carly and well anyway

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:40.120
I don't care I'm from Seville natalan cres and Jerry trainor have stopped following

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.800
nickelodion and the ik carlin o account on social networks Either way, they would have separated the issue, these two

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:50.400
were making a sequel, okay, a sequel to Carly has been broadcast, which is supposed to be

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.440
their life when they are older, and it hasn't been very successful, but it didn't last long, so they decided not to

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.360
extend it . more or whatever but this time the series per Ã­a paramon has been broadcast on paramon Plus

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.040
yes it is true that nickelodion also now belongs to paramon so in some way

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.760
They are still linked to them but well let's see more than anything These are public gestures that are made

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:16.160
to imply support for the victims to imply their rejection by the producers, the

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.600
directors and all the adults who were involved is a gesture more than anything worth the

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.680
Carly series had been resumed a few years ago years with these actors but not on nickelodion but

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.600
on paramon Plus as I was telling you with the adult life between them although it was canceled After

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:35.520
three seasons even though it was having success eh things are the way they are paramont is the

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.760
current owner of Nickelodeon since 2019 so it is still related to Nickelodeon, it is not the same

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:47.000
studio but they have taken into account Dan Sneider to write series and movies like

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.280
I am 102 but in this specific one he was not in the sequel to Carly, he was not, it must

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:59.360
also be clarified that in the paramon series that ran until 2023, Janette Macardy did not participate, even though

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:05.920
she was offered a lot of money, she did not want to know anything about these people and look, it was

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.280
a good offer. But right now she is comfortable doing the things she He has

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:15.440
a podcast recently. He just released the book. He dedicates himself to giving talks and so on. Basically, he did it to

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.400
reject anything that was related to his trauma

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.200
. the next ones ok If I don't record it tomorrow

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.760
I will record it the day after but I have yet to release the video with Jen Maardi's story that you

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.560
have asked me a lot in the comments box I promised it in one of the first videos and

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:39.040
I haven't done it yet because I think These were before, okay, I'll do it, subscribe to the Channel, like,

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.160
follow me on my Twitter, on my Instagram, and all those things that I'll let you know about there,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.360
okay, Jack Salvatore, actor in the series I am, also wanted to get involved in

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:55.360
this topic in some way. and he has released a video with a certain irony that I don't quite understand Bo we Uh let's talk

00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.200
about it My name is Jack I was a child actor on Z 101 One of this Guy shows worked in his Production

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:09.860
department as intern oning And I worked on and Victor Max documentary that was recently [Music]

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.760
really But well I understand that by throwing some data

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.320
like that above like Dan took a shotgun to threaten people

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:28.920
like he boasted about money and with this he humiliated people who had lower salaries

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.000
we could talk about the fact That he would literally tell his Gold Coin Collection in front

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.440
of his Crew Who was paying check to pay it no and the treatment that the actors gave to the people on the crew

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:46.360
and dem we talk about the High Level conversations was supposed to hear about howan didn't 't want to

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.840
recommend antidepressants for Jeanette mur after her mom Died for fear that She might Kill herself

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.200
and make the Network look Bad but what I do Want To talk about Is Never letting this Stuff happen

00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:01.120
Again This is an entire Industry built on hope and Dreams and adrenal and desire fulfillment and

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:07.000
that can be a very dangerous Thing foral maniacs toel even in posting this I'm a little afraid is

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.080
this Going To screw up my career moving Forward I have no idea but I think It's important and it

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.720
needs to be said Because of my Silence ensures the perpetuation of environments I don't want

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:21.880
to work and above all it is also important that I forgot to comment on this topic in the previous video,

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:28.840
he was criticizing that the interviewer was a person from the team that we will now go to That,

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.040
as you have been telling me in the comments of the previous videos,

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:44.000
the boy who interviews Dan Sneider in that embarrassing video that he uploaded to his

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.280
YouTube channel is one of the actors from i Carly, that is, the boy has He met Dan for whatever it

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:55.480
was that suited him and Dan hired him for this ridiculous scheduled interview planned

00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:01.320
every question planned every answer what credibility does that boogie have, the boy's name

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.440
is It's normal that the video at this moment in which I'm recording this one I'm seeing it with

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:12.040
an extension okay it has more than 121,000 dislikes completely normal but it should have what

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:17.320
worries me In fact it's the 10,000 likes the 10,000 likes that makes me very worried jaay Lewis the

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:23.160
actor who starred in the Just Jordan series has also come out to report that well It seems

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:29.480
to be the reason why Just Jordan was canceled suddenly the actor has signed on his social media accounts

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:35.960
that he did not want to give away his ass worth what I would understand as that they tried to extort him

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:41.520
in some way or that there was a promise If he allowed himself to do the things that they wanted

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.120
him to do Well, I don't think it's necessary to go into much more detail either Because the

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:50.760
insinuation is Clear No, well, that too, there is another actor who had not yet spoken out until

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:57.120
just a few years ago. hours I'm talking to you about Josh so not to be confused with Brian Pak

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:02.360
has absolutely nothing to do with Brian Pak who is Drake's abuser Jos Pak Although he has the

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:08.600
same last name he has absolutely no relationship he was the partner who co-stars

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:16.440
in the series Drake and Jos Drake and Jos, well, Jos, everyone was demanding that he

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.520
speak out about everything that was happening and reproaching him for being silent and not saying

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.120
anything. What a shame that he said something, and of course something

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.880
that had to be clarified here had to be clarified. It was escaping people and when I was sharing work with Drake

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:36.200
at that time Dan Sneider was there but Drake's abuser was not there because he had already been

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:41.160
reported and they were waiting for the trial, these abuses that Drake suffered had not been while

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.400
who was filming this series but that they had been previous in the series of Amanda's show and in

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.520
the castings to which Brian accompanied him Haas on the microphone and you sound great alien Let's see

00:19:50.520 --> 00:20:00.120
I must sound as if we were from space not from Paris Hey it's not Drake 's way of talking to

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.880
people, upon seeing that they were canceling on social networks and asking

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.360
his ex-partner for these explanations, he decided to come out and comment that I had contacted him privately

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.920
that he had been worrying about him and that well, not everything has to be

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:22.180
public that at any time when he felt like it he would go out and say whatever [Music]

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:32.520
is is really Uh you know processing this and going through This is a really emotional Time

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:38.800
and a lot of It's very very difficult Uh so not Everything Is put out to the public um but I just

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:45.480

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:02.760
on him he ended up coming out and speaking out on the subject with the following statement on his

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:08.240
Instagram account I finished the kit on setet documentary and took a few days to process it I contacted

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:14.000
Drake privately but I want to give my support to the survivors who were brave enough

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.320
to share their emotional and physical stories of abuse on Nickelodeon sets

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.800
children who should have been protected reliving this publicly is incredibly

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:29.640
difficult but I hope it can bring the healing To the victims and their family as well as the

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:34.400
necessary change in our industry family as you can see the video is becoming full of information and

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.080
I think it is taking too long So it just occurred to me that we are going to

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:42.160
make a second part and in a few hours keep an eye on the Channel because I am going to upload

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.160
another video where I am going to tell you everything that has been left pending, which is no small thing at the moment

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.200
in which the second part of This video is published I am going to leave it posted in the

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.440
comments box so you can go there immediately and don't miss it because I really

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.760
have a lot left but I don't want this video to last 3 hours so well

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.880
see you in the next video ok I hope you like it I hope you're liking it I'm

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.840
reading the comments box see you in no time so be very careful

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:18.320
bye
