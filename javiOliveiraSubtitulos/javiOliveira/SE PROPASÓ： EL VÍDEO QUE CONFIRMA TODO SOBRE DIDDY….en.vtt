00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.720
The scene with which we are going to start today's video is going to leave us indifferent. It belongs to

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.640
the series Dad by Dan Sneider. You already know that Dan Sneider is a producer-director who is talked about

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.680
a lot. You also have a series on this channel. By the way. shadow of doubt that there is behind

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.720
him with shady things and it is precisely in this scene in which we bring together Dan neider with

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.240
pidid he wanted to have him for this somewhat strange cameo considering that this is a series for

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.560
teenagers that of In fact, they are teenagers who shoot for children in this scene where we see

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.360
Didi surrounded by a bunch of kids, trying to wake up a child by throwing a white liquid

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.560
in his face and then when the kids come up to ask him for advice, for some reason he asks him

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.880
to leave. I put a remote-controlled helicopter inside my pants and turn it on, I don't know, maybe

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.800
I don't understand the language, maybe there's a type of sarcasm here or something like that that I can't

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.760
quite get, but I think that taking into account everything I know is being shuffled today and everything

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.920
we have on the table danang sneider more pididi this looks a little strange no family

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:08.040
What are we Going To Do I don't know you know in situations like this yeah I Always

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:59.840
asleep try this

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.240
the contact of underage kids with some famous adults is a topic that we already

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.240
covered in depth in the series that I already have on the channel about dagan neer, for example Jamie

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.320
ling Spear, Brit's sister spe surprised us all when we learned of her participation in some

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.720
shady series of the elite although not of Peace Dad and that she was pregnant according to her by her boyfriend

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.520
at 15 years of age while she was filming a series on Nickelodeon For more than one person is

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.120
famous to have certain shady conversations with minors is just as bad Even if the minor

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.440
is also famous What's up with my youth I'm Javi Oliveira welcome one more day to the Channel in this

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.320
specific video We are going to go into depth into a series of contacts let's say you have had Didi

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.120
or Didi's environment with minors also relating to everything that is being played and their

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.560
famous parties and some even with supposed participation or well now we will see, you know

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.360
that this video is a second part of another that I uploaded yesterday So I recommend you that you

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.000
go to the channel first and watch the previous videos If you haven't seen them yet but

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.280
this also belongs to a complete playlist where I am uploading

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.880
everything covering the Pat Dad case and we already have enough videos so that you are well documented

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.000
on the subject I also tell you that I will continue covering the story and any news that comes out I will be

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.520
reporting here on this channel, you already know that here I deal with all the entertainment topics from the heart

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.600
of the cotio YouTuber sauces also TV news Practically everything that is viral Like this

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.520
If you like and are interested in this content, it is very important that I realize that it is

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.600
mandatory to subscribe to the Channel, which is also completely free and you will not

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.080
regret it, friends of Didi like Drey, who was Rihana's best friend Until 2018 where

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.960
they suddenly stopped following each other is a person very close to Didi who has remained silent all this

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.680
time in the previous video I was giving you some examples, such as billion se

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.320
in which some probably do not talk about Didi and do not want to report things or

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.960
speak out in respect and condemn him because they don't want doors to be closed or they are afraid of

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.440
commitment to friendships or simply that they have things to keep quiet about and they better keep quiet,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.000
I guess there is no need for introductions when we are talking about both Drake and the singer Milly

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.320
Bobby Brown Although she is probably better known to many as Eleven, this girl, in

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.600
an interview when she was 14, talking about the friendship she had with Drake, commented that she spoke

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.280
quite regularly with him on WhatsApp and that he was always telling her nice things.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.440
It was like I missed her, saying good night, conversations, conversations, good friendship,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.360
a bit strange considering the age difference between the two of us, we're talking about

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.040
a 31-year-old guy talking to a 14-year-old girl and maintaining this friendship and then she trying to

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.080
I imagine that clarifying so as not to leave things murky made it even worse by talking about how this

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.800
Drake was advising her and giving her guidelines to follow with the boys. So you're going to tell me what a

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.040
31-year-old guy looks like advising 14-year-old girls about How to act with the guys who want to flirt with her

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.720
I understand that they were colleagues in the profession and that the other with more experience was

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.960
giving her advice about the union, not and giving professional advice but about men I don't know how you see it

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.680
miss you so much miss you more He's coming to Atlanta so

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.360
I'm definitely going to go and see him What does he give you like What does he

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:26.560
say Drake responded to this at the time by asking the group not to interfere with his

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.240
friends and he has a lot I'm lucky to have incredible people in my life. You can't choose that

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:40.080
for me. It's good that people understand what I do. Now let's go back to talking about real problems

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.600
in this world that aren't my friends. My God, I don't know what I want me to tell you. But Yes, it is true

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.880
that a friendship between a guy with very black hair on his [__] and a minor to

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.120
whom he is constantly saying that he misses her, Good night, pretty patatín patatán and giving her advice about boys seems a little strange

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.920
. And how to be with them I don't know the truth is that this friendship seems a

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.760
little strange to me. We can actually compare it with Henry Kavil who also met

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.640
Miley during the filming of Nola Halmes and I tell you that we can compare it because Henry is true

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.160
that she became quite friendly with Milly Bobby but putting a certain amount of ground in between, that is, due to

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.800
the age difference between the two, it is true that he was evidently with her for

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.960
everything that was necessary and to show her his support as a professional and as a partner. but basically

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.000
he gave her some guidelines apparently in which they did not enter into personal areas that

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.760
were not appropriate between an adult and a minor. And we are talking about the fact that even though they had

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.800
a years difference in age, we are talking about the fact that she was 18 Whether you want it or not,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.440
it is true that she is still young but not small, like at 14, in that case everything was different, there are no

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.880
limits because it is as if we were all brothers, but with Henry he is very strict with me, which

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:52.880
I am grateful for. With Henry, he feels like a true adult relationship like a very good friendship a

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:59.640
very healthy one that we have terms and conditions I know Henry he has terms and conditions

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:06.720
with me I am not allowed to ask about his personal life he is like Milly Shut up no and I say something

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.280
like understood I think you understand the difference between How Henry led friendship and How

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.080
Drake led it and that is more than obvious, it is something. For example, Didi's relationship with Justin Baver

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.320
and what she did about having his guardianship for 48 hours, taking him to the party being a minor and having him

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.280
there drinking By the way, I don't know if you remember that in any of these videos I was talking

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.280
about Billy English who, before being famous, was like a big fan of Justin Bieber and when he

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.600
met her he sponsored her in a certain way and was giving her advice about the career and

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.400
so on so that things that had happened to him wouldn't happen to him it was like he protected her I don't want

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.400
her to lose him I don't want her to go through anything that I went through I wouldn't wish it on anyone

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.440
so yes yes some Maybe he needs me, I'm just a phone call away and it seems like Billy

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.000
was safe, no, and he stayed distant from Didi. Although, however, there is a

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.680
post on his Instagram in which he brags about having hugged Didi and puts those things in

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.760
the comments No, here you have what he put on his Instagram account, I'll put it translated okay Although

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.240
Yes, I also have to tell you here that Billy recently made a reference to Didi and her

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:16.680
freff parties in case you haven't understood what he's saying It's something like that after the

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.360
concert there will be a party but it won't be a party. It's a joke. Let's say another one who apparently

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:27.440
was saved was Sabrina Carpenter, who in 2019 at the age of 19 was already a former Disney star.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.320
at the beginning of his career he joked with Kesha's tiktok lyrics you already know the kesa

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.320
tiktok song that now by the way he is changing it is rerecorded because he is completely

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.760
against and deeply condemns what is happening with Didi and he very much regrets

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.440
having that cameo in one of her most popular songs well well Sabrina Carpenter carpenter

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.800
because it is translated well well Sabrina in this tweet I woke up in the morning feeling like

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.560
p Didi is a nod to the song he is mentioning that verse of that song but well let's hope

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.000
that finally not has never attended any of those parties, I think that no other person who tried

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.920
to stay away from was Selena Gómez, I think that Justin Bieber's best-known partner, even

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.280
the one he has today, was Justin Bieber's girlfriend in 2011, in fact. There is even talk

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.560
that she herself tried to keep Justin away from Didi, even though she didn't succeed very well, and

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.680
when Didi met her at a party, she pretended to confuse her with the one who parked the cars.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.920
Look, I see everything, I don't care. In fact, I laughed. hysterically when it happened but I

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:43.080
understand it I know what it's all about in one of Selena Gómez's songs I put it

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.640
here on the screen so as not to pronounce it I'm okay And I don't have much of my pronunciation

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.000
but practically there are many people who think that Selena does Surely she

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.880
was involved in one of this party and that this video clip is some

00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:01.520
reference, it could have absolutely nothing to do with it. And it could be a video clip that has absolutely no

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.840
reference to the padad party but you already know that these people are very into doing this

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.040
type of very direct, non-indirect references in his video clips. Even in the lyrics of his

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.160
songs, it is common for Justin Bieber. Even I believe that over the years we will

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.600
discover even more subliminal messages that Justin would have left in one of his video clips and

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.880
well, although supposedly If she had this tension with Didi, it is true that she has been seen,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:28.240
although not at the parties as such, involved in some after-events such as the NTTV that you already

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.040
know were also sponsored by Didi. Here you have the same image from 2023, that is,

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.360
not long ago. At this point the truth is that I have my doubts and I don't like it at all and it seems [__]

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.840
I hope I'm wrong but the clip is with naa the little friend of Didi's little daughters who in

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.760
this clip that I'm going to show you Next, he tells a little bit about how he met her and why she

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:59.240
calls him papa cams. Well, I don't know if the real version would be this, but the truth is that I don't like it.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:26.680
Well, did's modus operandi used to be when someone liked him. Well, let's see when I say he

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:31.280
liked it, I mean like a talent house, okay, let's say that to the kids, the children

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:36.400
or young people, he promised them the world as a flag, as they say, no. In other words, he promised them a promising future

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:42.560
in the world of stardom, this included taking them to big events. already big parties

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.640
and according to what is mentioned in this latest complaint that he used to drug people sometimes

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.000
by putting things in their drinks without them realizing this is a tremendous accusation okay but it is

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.240
what he is being accused of because then they suddenly woke up with Didi in the bed

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:07.840
in the press was that When when you were handed a drink and Now We know that the drink is la was

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:13.320
something if you refuse to drink it You were kicked out of the party Let that sink in for

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:20.160
a minute I mean the admission To This Party was that you Had to drink this the chosen drink that

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:27.600
was handed to you Uh and Now We know that in most cases I would say 9% of the cases Uh

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.000
these individuals were drugged with some sort of drug That's that was kind of the mo another

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:40.280
instance this individual Who was 9 years old at the time Uh was taken to an audition in New

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:46.960
York City with Bad Boy Records Uh other Boys were there to audition as well All of them were

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:53.600
trying to Land a record deal All of them were miners Uh this individual was sexually abused

00:12:53.600 --> 00:13:02.400
allegedly by Sean comes and several other people at the Studio Uh prom his parents

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.440
and

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:18.800
de By that he would make him aar but he needed a visit with him in private about it

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:29.120
away from Uh his parents once Uh they were in a private area allegedly mres made the victim

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:39.240
Upon him another incident an individual 15 years old at the time flown to New York City to attend

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:47.000
a Party Uh Was drugged and then taken into a private room allegedly in the presence of Mr

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:59.200
comes Uh Where this Uh female individual Minor and then other indiv tooks ind 2

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:07.080
the time of the occurrence Uh was picked up by allegedly by Mr comes and several other

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:14.400
people Uh in a Black suv from the airport Uh was given One drink in the suv and then

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:19.880
literally woke up the next day not knowing What Had happened but with Pain and damage to both

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:29.040
her She then went to the hospital She was missing her underwear and her Shoes

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:36.880
another instance individual Uh this Time not a Minor Uh was attended a Group dinner allegedly

She drank at the table apparently at least according to her was laced with something She

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:59.040
blacked out and She woke up In The same Bed Again allegedly with Mr hes And I could go on I mean

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:15.000
in fact some things are so delicate things that I can't even mention here because

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.920
YouTube gets silly, but people who arrived with wounds on their parts where

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.400
they shouldn't have wounds and signs of being drugged with horse medicine

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:29.200
, that is, we are talking about very strong things, not in this complaint

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:35.480

cocaine and this horse tranquilizer in her Blood System Had he not been

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.400
also highlighting one thing that I was telling you in the previous video but in case

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.560
you haven't seen it, there were more than 3000 people who contacted this

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:20.320
man 's buffet that you are looking at and they chose the 120 cases trying to Well summarize the

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.280
situation a little not to avoid having 3000 cases going to the clearest ones okay going to the

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:29.160
most powerful ones now I don't know if you agree with me that I understand that practically no one

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.480
is with all their money and with all his means trying to get an agreement in which

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:38.600
they put him on conditional release and blah blah blah and he doesn't get it, I honestly think that he has a

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.840
very difficult time on this occasion. In fact, I think that not only should he fall, but

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.920
they should also find out who They have been Accomplices because he has not been able to do this alone Selma Fonseca,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.880
Didi's photographer. During the last 20 years she said that at all of Didi's parties

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.840
she saw minors and that she also has thousands of photos where it can be verified sadly despite

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.760
being published on her page, some of them are very sensitive to the fact that no one

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.680
publishes them without agreeing on remuneration, that is, I don't know, the truth is that I see her a little strange.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.040
I don't understand if she wants to collaborate or rather wants to take advantage of the situation, in fact. Well,

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:16.080
here I am going to be putting some Although they are going to be a little blurred, that is, the editor is going

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:20.360
to blur them a little, it is going to differentiate more or less the photos and They are as they are, no

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:24.160
, but since it is a little delicate with the subject copyright, I see her capable of claiming

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:29.040
the video from us, so well, here you have the website. Look here, the editor will be putting

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.640
the link for you so that you can go see her website, but let's see, you can clearly differentiate

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:38.480
that there are people here. that they are not of legal age or a joke, the Mexican singer

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.760
Elan has also come out, who was in the world of music at the beginning of the 2000s and all these parties. She says

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:50.000
that as such she never attended a Didi party but pay attention some party of Leonardo

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.160
DiCaprio Leonardo DiCaprio is coming out quite splashed in this investigation and it does not surprise me

00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:01.320
that he was saving this clip the controversial topic of next year of 2025 2026 that is, he has

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.040
too many strange things this man we have already been seeing throughout the videos that we have been

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.880
covering in this series as we have caught images of him smelling the hair of young girls and all this

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:15.280
talk about him that every time a girlfriend turns 25 he leaves her fortunately never but

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.440
I do want to tell you one thing The music industry has always been this thing of

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.200
connections and parties and meetings has been the type of person who, if he arrives at a place and feels

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.000
a negative or heavy vibe, I leave, I leave at that moment, I don't have to stay there

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.520
to see if things get worse, in fact, yes, I had several parties at his house but I go back

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:37.840
to the same thing, that is, on the day you arrive, everything is fine, everything is normal, the people seem normal. This is kind of like

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:43.640
something like zombies or like vampires, the sun goes down, things get a little strange. and you leave

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:49.840
well that's what I really did Hollywood is full of sharks and [__] so elitos for

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.720
me has always been better some have commented like with the other video that I uploaded saying that

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:58.240
I had been at Leonardo Decapro's house for certain parties saying that I was leaving early and

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.440
everyone said no and of course everyone says they are leaving early to see I'm not everyone's

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:07.760
number one no no I'm not trying to convince I mean I don't have a heavy conscience I know I don't live there anymore

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:13.520
, I'm not there and I know why I'm not there and it's because I didn't like that life and this

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:19.800
and thank God it never got older so that I would say gee I have to escape from this so

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.080
I have the conscience completely Clear and I continue to say the same thing there are more than those who believe there are

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.680
many more just while I am recording This video Juanito has published this tweet the

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.800
night when no one believed brne peer in 2007 while they were celebrating the birthday of Casandra

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:39.000
Ventura ex-partner of Didi sa casasi had to carry Britney Spear out and the press assumed

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.160
it was because she was an alcoholic. To this day she claims that someone drugged her by putting

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:50.040
something in her drink. Among the guests were Dallas at Paris Hilton and obviously Cindy. camps

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.320
