00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.040
One of the things that we have been commenting on the most about everything that revolves around the Didi

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.200
Camps case is their relationship and possible something that would have happened with Justin Bieber. Strange is the video in which

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.360
we have not mentioned Justin Bieber Because almost everyone every day we get some news in

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.560
fact in the last few hours Sources close to Justin have confirmed to a media outlet

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.040
that Justin is quite affected right now with everything that is happening, it is not

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.280
exactly known very well what they wanted to give to understand with this topic when saying

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.640
this but probably that many things are being removed from his past or that he is simply

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.640
having a hard time knowing that Didi is in jail for all the good relationship and the Rose

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.480
that he has had with him and that simply well According to this source, a media called Us Weekly does not like it,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.480
the story that Justin experienced with Didi was quite harsh but all the processing

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.320
and all the charges that are being brought against him because he is not finishing processing them well. In fact,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.880
in the previous video I was with you showing a photograph that Justin's wife uploaded with

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.560
which she sent a fairly direct message. Although they were direct, Justin is in a

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.960
difficult mental situation at the moment, he has a very difficult history with Didi and the accusations

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.600
against him have been difficult to process. I also understand this as when you find out

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.960
more things that a person with whom you have had a close relationship has done that perhaps you did not

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.640
know. Well, all this impacts you and if you already had a little doubt about that person, then you will fall

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.880
much more and will disappoint you much more by following the advice of his lawyers and also his

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.240
advisors, he has remained as removed from the case and from all the media hype as possible, the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.040
youtuber of the review has uploaded a couple of videos denying some of the conspiracies that There is

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.800
around this topic, I recommend that you see it because it is another quite interesting point of view.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.520
By the way, and it is very good. And I especially highlight a compilation of evidence that he would have shown

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.680
in his video, which denies the fact that Justin had passed 48 hours under Didi's tutelage

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.040
. In other words, if the two of them had been alone and spent 48 hours together, this would not

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.080
magically prove that Didi has abused Justin. The only thing that could prove that would be if Justin said

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.080
yes and said yes, Didi abused me, but that didn't even happen. has happened nor does it look like it will happen

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.440
considering that they were still friends Until last year and we can publicly see all the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.000
things he did from the October 26th when he arrived until he left October 26th Justin bber and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.040
Los Angeles the October 27 he had a photo shoot October 27 he was on a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.080
basketball court on October 28 he went to a radio interview on October 29 he went to a

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.200
Microsoft event as you can see here on October 30 there are no photos but Yes, we have a tweet from Justin

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.120
Bieber. On October 31, he was at another radio station giving another interview in October wearing the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.880
same jacket and the radio station was there from 6 pm to 8 pm and the video he recorded with

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.680
Didi It's daytime now starting at 800 pm it is already night and on top of that the radio station

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.920
attended a Halloween party with his friends here you can see him with his friends it is already night

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.320
And this is the complete timeline at an event in Levis then in Didi's house and then at

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.800
night he went to the radio and a party with his friends. In addition, he would also comment on the question that until

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.960
last year both Didi and Justin maintained at least cordiality or that they were friends Until

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.920
last year and that Justin didn't need Didi to have fallen for all the additions

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.120
he fell into, let's not even say he spent 48 hours with Didi, this is a filthy lie, but

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.920
even if I have spent 48 hours with him, which is not the case, let's remember that bber was always accompanied

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.840
everywhere with his mother, the only time when Justin Bieber let himself talk to his mother was

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.440
when he got into lasd eem gas and that was already in 2015 when he was already more than of age, there are

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.520
people saying that Justin bber got into those substances because of Didi when the truth is

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.160
that you don't need a guy to get you into those kinds of substances for you to get fully involved and be

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.440
a drug addict Yes and without bber he was abused by Didi There is no proof of this

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.040
Not even the slightest bit of it, but literally not even a little bit of evidence and now like this people

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.480
put it everywhere saying oh how bad how Justin was abused on this channel we have commented

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.560
as you already know all the conspiracy theories the rumors trying to differentiate it or At least

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.520
making it clear what the real and verified data are in fact. Thanks also to all the

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.440
rumors and all the theories that have been put forward and that we have been commenting on, we have had 16 videos that,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.040
by the way, I recommend that you go through the list of complete reproduction and see it all

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.960
if you want to be well immersed in the whole topic of the case of Cindy the camps if we had not

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.680
also commented on all the conspiracy theories that have come out we would have been left with three

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.920
videos and I think you don't believe that so what pass my youth welcome one more day to the Channel I'm

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.800
last few days Didi has been declaring we do not have images we do not have audio they have not let the

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.720
camera or any digital recording method, the only thing that some accredited media outlets have stopped passing by,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.880
some journalists with lifelong paper and pencil to take notes.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.760
So I will tell you everything that is known about that statement And how things are going to happen. Sometimes the rumors

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.280
come from close sources, sometimes for example, like the case that I am going to give you below,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.040
Tupac's brother was commenting that he asked Didi at the time if he had anything

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.120
to do with the murder of his brother Tupac, who already I know that on that topic Well, there are a lot of

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.280
accusations and after 27 years the very brother of your pack affirms that he does not believe

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.800
Didi And he does think perfectly well that he could have had something to do with his brother's death,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.600
you know. For example, Will's wife, who was a very good friend of Tupac, also thinks that Didi

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.760
could have had something to do with it. There are many people who think that he is a very powerful person

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.000
with the ability to get out of Rosita on many occasions. accusations and some

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.640
acts my brother was King of the Hill top dog King of rap and with it comes a lot of jealousy

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:40.920
I It's Pretty Direct there from 50 Cent Yes It was you know And I Know that everyone believes

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:47.000
that didy was involved in both these shootings that is what the streets have said for 27 years

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.120
We were all familiar with All the rumors and Stuff I said yeah Let me talk to him What did

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.880
he Say that day when he called you you know I have my guys With Me live guys and Uh we heard

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.000
What he Had to say basically said he ain't have Nothing to do with my brother's murder

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:09.360
Don't talk about things that are thinky posses of Looking that here we are7 28 years later

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.800
the involvement him is quite High on the list our family you know we Still all wrapped up he

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.040
was Still shaking The Bed he really Wanted to Tell Me Something I'm assuming It was something

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:29.560
Had to do with the hit I get the feeling quite strongly that you don't seem gotch of Something that all the journalists who have been in the room and have been able to see

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.480
Didi in person have highlighted

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.080
has been about his physical appearance. The journalists who have been able to see in person how

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.360
Didi is currently and how he appeared in the room on the side of the player with a

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.800
brown suit, the typical one from when you are in prison, I understand from there and that Didi would have recovered

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.240
now that he is not partying and sticking to excess the figure of the 90s, that is, he has seemed much

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.440
thinner and as I have already told you, well It has not been possible to take photographs or recordings and what

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.520
we do have are drawings drawings that more or less represent the moments that have been lived in the

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.760
room. It seems that Didi could have been close to her children or almost all of her children and her mother as well.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:19.520
his lawyers and gave them all a hug, he was seen laughing at several moments in the statement. The

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.320
prosecutor Emily Johnson has rejected the request of Didi's defense, which, as I already told you in the video

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.600
Previously, I wanted to argue that it would be necessary to rule out the procedure to invalidate that video that

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.280
went so viral a few months ago where Didi in a hotel running through the corridors after

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.320
that ex-partner literally beat up almost where it was demonstrated What was the attitude

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.280
of Didi in privacy, well, not so intimate because we are talking about a hallway in a

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.560
fairly popular hotel and this would demonstrate that many things that have been said about him are

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.040
true. The prosecutor has rejected the accusation that Didi's defense was making that That video

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.120
was leaked by the government, well anyway, I'm not telling you either. In other words, the fact that

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.080
they want to invalidate that video for the procedure seems silly to me because it would be as simple

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.640
as it is good, we discard the video but we have all the means of communication that have spoken

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.320
on this topic, that is, in the end, the case of Almost is already prescribed. Furthermore, she reached

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.920
an agreement with him, that is, that is closed to him and they are not going to condemn him for what he did, they are not

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.600
going to ever condemn him for That beating, that video would only serve to give a little context

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.400
and validity, not to the attitude and accusations that are being made to Didi. In the end,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.800
I'll tell you, it doesn't matter to me if you present the video as such or a lot of media. digital communications

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.800
on paper on TV that have echoed what appears in that video and the truth.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.720
So in the end, as such, I don't understand why they are so interested in canceling that video,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:45.120
that video has already been seen by the entire planet. In addition, the prosecutor says that she has more than 96

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.920
electronic devices. I imagine that they will be CDs and USBs. Also, this is the result of the raids

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:57.600
that have been carried out both in Didi's mansions and in the private jet with 90 TB of

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.080
digital information. I mean, 90 tb doesn't just take up photographs, eh, not even

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.920
audio recordings, I mean, there have to be quite powerful videos because the prosecutor talks about It's good that

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.760
why fight so much, not to reject that video in which she mistreats almost when they have In those

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:18.240
90 TB, the evidence is much worse, that is, much worse. Who knows what is there recorded

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:25.680
in videos? I am completely sure that those are videos. 90 TB is like approximately 10,000

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:33.160
Blu-rays in 4K or more than 6,000 movies in 1080, that is. Full HD By the way, the prosecutor has commented

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.000
about these devices that there are some videos that are not capable of playing, I imagine that

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.240
due to the issues of formats, compatibility, drivers or whatever. But well, I imagine

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.200
that it will not be a problem that the FBI be able to solve in the end you can get all the

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.000
possible documentation for when the trial is next year, this one you are seeing on

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.440
the screen is the judge in charge of the Didi case arun suramin is the first judge of Indian origin

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.520
in the district of New York was recently promoted by Joe Biden And apparently he has

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.720
a lot of experience in criminal and commercial cases, apparently the guy is a crack And

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.920
well, Didi has seemed calm even sometimes when they were reminding him of the

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:14.160
charges that are being brought against him requesting, the guy was laughing, in fact, apparently they have charged him with more charges

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.080
than we already knew. Likewise, Didi had some smile there, that is, as if demonstrating

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.440
or at least interpreting an attitude that he would not be worried about everything that is

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.280
coming to him. Or maybe it will come to him and his lawyer, for his part, continues fighting and says that he will

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:33.120
do everything possible so that he is free until the trial date is in May of next year

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:44.480
decision to the circ and we to Keep trying to Get him out That's available to Us

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:52.720
I only know what happens and that hasn't happen What argument to exude hotel most

00:10:52.720 --> 00:11:01.520
respectful put Our paper Yesterday and Notice that in fact what the lawyer has highlighted is

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.640
that the most difficult thing for Didi has been The issue of food, although it is not bad at all considering

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.560
that he is in a prison, is what the Metropolitan detention center

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:15.560
where Coms is currently detained in would be the worst. It usually serves hamburgers, baked fish

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.880
or meat tacos for lunch. during the week with scrambled eggs and

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:25.800
biscuits on the weekends for dinner they offer chicken fajitas pasta and roast beef as well as

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.640
healthy and vegetarian meals And well, as I was telling you a few minutes ago,

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.840
her children, well, almost all of her children, her mother as well, whom you can also see in the

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.680
drawings that have been drawn of her, you can also see her in the background with glasses, they attended the

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.040
Didi's statement to see him in person, not to have that contact, no And to

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.560
also show him support as they are there, the mother was booed a few times at the exit

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:59.240
and entrance of the courthouse with people yelling at her, your son is a predator

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:29.160
. before you go back to

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.880
JC and Billon's lawyer, he is a fairly well-known lawyer for those of us who follow

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:48.400
celebrity cases Alex Spiro Alex Spiro already represented Alex Balvin in his case, it is a case

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.320
that we have also followed on the channel here you have the video I recommend that you see it, it turned out

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.120
quite well for Alex after firing a gun that was supposed to be a prop

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.880
and killing a producer, you have the context in the video, okay, he came out innocent and

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.160
is currently also the lawyer for the mayor of New York who is right now accused of

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.240
corruption and that he has a certain good deal with Didi, eh. In addition, he has even given him the key to the city.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.680
No, this lawyer has given an interview in which he has come out to clarify a little what happened

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.520
in that jaguar interview in the Pierce Morgan's program we were commenting on it in

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.840
the two previous videos Jaguar accused JC and billion C of having super shady things including

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:33.280
kidnappings and things like that and Pier Morgan upon receiving the notification from the lawyer

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:39.040
Well, he decided to notify so that the thing would not be more on the topic of bon c JC remaining silent

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.120
about all the accusations and everything that is happening with Didi because it does not clarify

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.680
much simply that they will talk if they feel like talking at some point but practically that

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.640
what happened was a warning not only for Pier Morgan as such And for his program

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.600
but for anyone who dares to accuse him of any crime or accuses the couple of whatever

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:03.760
they have in mind as the accusation, according to the slander, they are going to defend themselves in

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:15.760
court show and then of levels vish Were you ready for like this to eventually happen Listen

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.960
there's rumors and then there's nonsense and This is one Step further right This is a pointed and

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:26.280
formal accusation of Something I felt it needed to be responded to so I think someone reported

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:33.240
It was a ceist it wasn't that It was quite bluntly an ultimatum which is remove that false accusation

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:38.520
um That's demonstrably false um or a court's Going To order you to and so I think he made

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:44.480
the wise Choice and acted accordingly he meaning pier Morgan removing it and apologizing for it Yes

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:51.840
What changed here in my mind is that someone On A so-called journalistic platform exploited that

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:58.080
kind of Random ror mill whether It's disconnected from reality or What have you and lifted it up um

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.440
and by doing that you know they not only caused harm here but They are also drone out the voices

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:09.080
of real victims and by doing that to get clicks it didn't Just harm the Carters what what

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.680
he did effectively was to drone out the voices of of actual victims in an ongoing Case in an ongoing

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.880
investigation and that was that was too much for me what I am here to say is that in a situation

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:24.080
as serious as this um someone Who puts them out as a journalist should not effectively Take

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.960
advantage of the situation and exploit someone in this way and so That's That's the real reason for

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.320
car I can Tell you that When they put their Foot down on something like they did here you

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.080
know They are sending a message and If they can't Stand up and and make sure right from wrong then

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:52.760
Who other than Apparently he has preferred to stay away from the subject. While the atmosphere is

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.240
hot, it has been Leonardo DiCaprio who is currently taking a vacation

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:03.480
with his girlfriend Victoria cti Italy who, by the way, recently turned 26, a new record for

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:08.000
Leonardo DiCaprio And he was leaving to all their partners every time they approached or reached

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.040
the age of 25. So congratulations on the new record, you know that Leonardo DiCaprio has

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.160
been very involved in all the parties, he has attended Didi's parties a lot, he was very

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.960
present has done many things does not mean that he is guilty of anything but well the truth is that

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.440
he has been seen a lot there at the moment he is not being investigated nor does he have any charges in

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.440
the case but well yes serc is mentioning a lot about this case because there are a

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.120
lot of photos and a lot of videos appeared surrounded by all these people Mike Tyson of which I

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.560
clicked on one of the last videos in which there was a slightly strange situation in

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.000
a television program it didn't seem Like Didi wanted to touch his leg or something like that,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.440
in an interview he gave to the Daily Mail, he made some statements when asked

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.760
about the subject that were considered somewhat unfortunate for the public. And he

00:16:53.760 --> 00:17:01.480
said wait, I'm synonym of Didi Well that's great he said I never knew I wish him the best

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.960
in life I wish him the best and it's clear that at this moment someone comes out who

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.640
is already confronting people who don't come out and talk. people are quiet and someone so

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.360
powerful and famous comes out wishing Didi luck because people have not taken it well the drummer of

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:21.880
blink 182 and his son lon had a party to celebrate the latter's 21 years parodying one

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:27.560
of the famous parties from Didi something that has not been taken well at all And it is that Who

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:32.080
can think of at this moment not being famous and publish something similar But well I imagine that at

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.440
least we will always have humor left for me, for example I put this publication on Twitter a

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.560
couple of weeks ago and at a meeting of friends we had a party to celebrate an

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.440
Ibizan party that they call it here we don't have to all dress in white and I made the joke

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.760
about Didi's parties no and well yes, There was some comment that was made to me in responses

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:54.160
to the twit of people telling me Javi that's not a joke, patatín patatán and I understand that the atmosphere

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.080
is delicate and maybe it was an unfortunate joke and most of all, for his part, he starts

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:05.480
talking about the elite and is warning of who wants to go out and also expose things, says that he

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:11.640
probably knows 80% of the elite behind the media and that he knows how

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:22.440
many puppets are handled. anyone kind of mastermind not like seems to be of mar

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:28.760
some most

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.440
has also mentioned the subject From Epstein's list, something that we were also discussing

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.640
on the channel, you have a playlist or you can easily find it by going to the

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.760
home page of my channel, there I have everything organized in series And yes, what he mentions is true

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:57.440
. Quite suspicious that such a shady case in which it has now been demonstrated, above all, the

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:03.440
serious things that were involved, that even though Epstein is not there, no one has been

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.800
convicted yet, apart from his wife, for complicity and for being involved with that guy, he says. They are

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.040
probably very busy investigating protesters but they never look at the powerful. It is curious

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:19.280
that in one day they capture 600 protesters but that in a year no one from the epting lists allows me

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.480
but here I quite agree, curious at least not and the most pointed directly

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:28.920
to several millionaires, such as Reid Hoffman, creator of LinkedIn, Bill Gates, owner

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.160
of Microsoft, whom we mentioned many times in this series we did about Jeffrey, and he claims

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.280
that these two in particular would be especially terrified of what could come out of them

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:44.880
related to that island and be careful they would also be afraid if Trump won the elections well

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:51.360
See That list do you think I don't know It's It's Mind blowing that that um that they've

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.720
not tried to prosecute even One not even the worst offender on on the F client list they've not even

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:01.760
tried to prosecute even One That's insane well Cuz they have a lot of diabetic grandmothers Who were

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.160
outside the capital on January 6 they they're kind of occupied yeah I mean they've put like Whatever

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:12.760
5 or 600 janary 6 protesters in Prison and not One person on the F client list Will That Ever come

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:18.560
out Do You Think You know II think part of Why kamal is getting so much Support is that Uh If If

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.080
Trump wins that F client list is going to become public Yes and some of Those billionaires behind

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:28.760
kamala are terrified of that outcome yeah do you think reed hoffman's uncomfortable Yes and Gates

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.760
and Gates yeah And I only asked that Cuz You Can you just Look at them and You're like that That's

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:39.040
a nervous person right there I don't know I mean I assume you know them yeah Yes Uh reof was my

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:48.240
Vice President bu development of PayPal yeah 24 years ago he does he seem nervous to you yeah I

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:53.080
mean He's terrified of Trump victory Because of the disclosure That would follow I think yeah

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:58.600
I mean I think He's certainly ideologically not aligned with Trump anyway but I think he

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.760
then affirms that between did epstein the government has to have hundreds of hours of recordings

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:16.280
found and wonders why they have not released it. He also says that the people in those

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:21.040
videos who have not wanted to release the authorities are giving lectures and going from Adal to

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.240
morality surely in many parts of the country and the planet This is something that will surely

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:31.840
seem quite common to you, it always does not fail to say that all these famous people and millionaires

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.680
like to question the morals of others a lot, taking advantage of the fact that they keep their

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.560
little secrets and I would also affirm that Thanks to Twitter, I'm not going to stop calling it Twitter.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:58.800
In life, all this is coming to light and is being talked about all over the world.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:03.400
of footage here Yeah yeah It's kind of weird that The People on Those videos are reading the Rest

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:08.120
of Us about Our moral failings isn't it yeah It's weird What is that um well I mean part of how they

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:14.920
deflect attention from themselves is by you know criticizing the morals of others Yes so they It's

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.200
sort of like a preemptive moral strike I mean as I said I think those who are saying Trump is a

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:23.440
threat to democracy are themselves actually the threat to democracy it feels like we're

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:28.520
Getting to a Place Where the Rest of Us know too much is this know what I mean It's easier

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.120
than I really recommend that you look for that interview because he also says very

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:47.360
interesting things like that he is trying to create laws where people who

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.640
do things on social networks pay for their crimes and take responsibility for the

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:56.120
things that are done on the internet but that of course on their platform they are going to fight because

00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:01.240
there is no censorship family here we are today's video I hope you liked it

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.240

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.840
