life would have corrected me in some

life would have corrected me in some

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
other way that maybe the host
 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.230 align:start position:0%
other way that maybe the host

would have been more tocha probably
but <00:07:33.434><c>I </c><00:07:33.628><c>think </c><00:07:33.822><c>that </c><00:07:34.016><c>in </c><00:07:34.210><c>life </c><00:07:34.404><c>when </c><00:07:34.598><c>you're</c>

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:38.070 align:start position:0%
but I think that in life when you're

doing like this in the end you crash I
 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.869 align:start position:0%
doing like this in the end you crash I

00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:39.879 align:start position:0%
had to crash because with what
 

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:41.950 align:start position:0%
had to crash because with what

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
