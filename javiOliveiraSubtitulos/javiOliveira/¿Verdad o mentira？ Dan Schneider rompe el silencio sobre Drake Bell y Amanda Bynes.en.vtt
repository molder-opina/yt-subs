00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.960
family How are you, welcome one more day to the Channel. I know that yesterday in the video that we published on

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.480
this channel, in case you haven't seen it, I'm going to leave it here in it and you'll find

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.400
the entire context of what happened and what happened. What's happening with Dan Sneider? I asked you and I promised you.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.280
If you wanted a little video with the whole story of Jannette McCarty, which by the way with these

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.040
videos I'm learning to pronounce the English of fucking mother, I was going to record it today but suddenly

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.080
just when the video was being released Yesterday, something has emerged and that is that Dan Sneider, after

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:40.040
7 years in which he has never responded absolutely to anything or any of the accusations that

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.400
have been made against him during these two decades in which the producer and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:53.120
director of children's series as famous as Amanda and Carly Drake Bell has spoken out and

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.440
responded to the documentary that is being broadcast where he is criticized for everything, whether or not

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.280
his answer will convince us. I will explain it to you and give you my opinion in this video but first we have to comment the

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.680
bomb And everything has exploded after Drake Bell recognizes that he was the victim for

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.560
which Brian was sentenced to 16 months in prison, this is how things are And the other answering on

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.480
YouTube only needed to start the video with a sigh What's up family How are you guys

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.560

TV news, celebrity news, well, subscribe, the two main protagonists of today's video

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.280
are at this moment that I'm recording the trending video on Twitter in several countries around the world,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.960
including the United States, and it is no wonder. And what they have both released is a bomb. TR

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.720
bomb. I think that first we should start where we left yesterday's video. I'll tell you,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.560
you can see. yesterday's video when you finish This video or you can watch it now before

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.840
continuing to watch this one if you don't know the context of what is happening It all starts when Brian

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.880
was hired as a dialogue and script coach for the second season on Amanda's show

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.560
later Later we will talk about Amanda's show and its protagonist And how it ended but

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.240
for now we are going to focus on this man Brian this man Brian p was a legend

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.520
in Hollywood he had worked with the most powerful celebrities on the planet and he seemed like a

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:48.680
nice person however When he met Drake

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.920
when he was 14 years old, he approached him in very

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:05.920
suspicious ways during their working relationship. Brian tried to get closer to Drake and

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.040
have excuses to spend more time with him than the work required and he touched and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.960
rubbed him in a strange way. At first, it seems that no one on the team was

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.280
suspicious or found anything strange, only Drake's father, who in addition to his father

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.400
was also his representative, this man, when he saw strange things, approached the production team

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.360
and complained about the behavior. that this gentleman had with his son, the response he got from

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.800
the production team that will surely have made sense with the passage of time

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.680
taking into account the things that have come out of there and from the producers of that network was that

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.720
Brian Pak was gay and therefore it was part of his personality that it was behavior

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.440
that he had that was effeminate and that gay people are more sensitive and are more fond of touching

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.320
people that now I find out in fact the father of break at the time To describe how he saw

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.520
the touching or the way of touching that this man had towards his son, he gives as an example

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.760
this video in which Brian assures that he has the same type of behavior With Leonardo

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:14.080
DiCaprio being Leonardo DiCaprio at that time, also a

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:30.560
child at first No one on the team, we suspect, studied to caress the children

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.840
that this gentleman had, but finally time, well, you have already found out where

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.240
this man came from. He was sentenced to 16 months in prison for abusing Drake Bell. But I will tell you that

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.920
below, Drake's father. He says he couldn't do anything because he didn't have

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.040
More than his suspicion that he didn't like him, he couldn't see how that person approached

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.640
Drake, apparently he got closer to Brian to the point of deciding

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.800
that he would be in charge of organizing his birthday party. When he turned 15

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.480
, he had a party that seemed to be a party for adults and his father accompanied him. In addition,

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.040
there was also a certain distance between his parents. His father did not have a good relationship with

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.200
his mother, so this was another ingredient to make things happen. It was not very fluid, there

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.320
was no communication between the parents and I think that obviously made things more complicated.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:30.600
Brian, upon seeing that Drake's father was an obstacle for them, decided to put it

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.720
into the heads of both Drey and his mother that the father did not handle

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.280
well the boy's bail so they decided that he would no longer be the

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:55.280
manager and with this the father was removed in one fell swoop so that he would no longer

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.640
be present on the filming set while the series was being recorded [Music]

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.560
imagine a little the calico no there was no mismanagement in Drake's finances the father

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:19.240
already had the fly behind his ear because of how that guy approached his son and receives a call from

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.360
the mother with whom things are tense stating that the son does not He wants me to be his manager more

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:32.000
and Who took his surprise place? Brian after cheating and eating El Coco from both him and

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000
his mother. Brian Pak became Drick's manager, little by little he gained the trust of

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.160
his mother. Taking advantage of the fact that his mother apparently did not like driving and was too

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.680
lazy to attend certain auditions, she trusted Brian to take her son everywhere

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:59.080
and even on some occasions used the excuse of the time that maybe she would Brian 's house

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.480
was closer to where they had to go he spent some nights sleeping at

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.800
Briane 's house

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:24.680
anding and home exc he came up with and the happ for While the story of the abuse

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.720
doesn't have much more Drake was sleeping in the same place as He slept regularly

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.920
every time he stayed at his manager's house and one of the nights he

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.480
woke up in the middle of the night and this man was touching him

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:47.920
inappropriately and up his eyes up and was at first he was petrified he

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.800
didn't know how to respond no I didn't know what to tell him, it wasn't a time when

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.600
kids had cell phones with which they could have called their mother or something like that,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.440
and

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.840
there was no plan to ask him for the phone so that he could call

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.800
his mother to let her know. what had just caught him red-handed

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:20.400
bri He apologized to Drake, he stated that he didn't know what had happened to him, that it had completely gone away.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:34.480
Well, thinking about his future job and in a state of shock, I imagine, and out of shame,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.760
he said it. He was silent for a long time Drake didn't see any other way out Brian

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.400
Pak He apologized to him he didn't know what reason to give his mother for not returning to

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.200
Brian's house after Brian was already his manager he had fooled the whole circle that he was

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:58.280
good Bri He ended up convincing his mother to let Dr sleep

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.440
in her house closest to the studios, and Drake didn't know why

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.880
he should start telling his mother or try to explain anything to her about what had

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:22.600
happened, according to Drake in the documentary. abuses were ever ever ever ever

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:29.360
so much so that he describes it as the most aggressive thing they can do to you in a

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:42.240
wor and and and worse abuse he claims that these abuses overshadow his life so much that during the entire time

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:48.440
of filming Drake and Josh being a star, being in her p, everything is blurry in her mind

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:54.440
because her life was overshadowed by the abuse of this man. He even had a girlfriend, he stayed to

00:09:54.440 --> 00:10:01.560
sleep at this girlfriend's house and the guy apparently was trying to locate him, he was trying to contact him, he called

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.440
the The girl's house was very angry, asking her for explanations. Look, what was the situation like?

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:12.720
Even the girl's mother, her new mother-in-law, came to realize that something was not right here and

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.720
took Drake to therapy, but once again out of fear or whatever. Well, he was not able to say

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:29.320
anything

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:37.800
about this whole situation like that until one day he explodes and in a call with his mother, according to

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.920
Comments, he shouts suddenly he explodes and feels like screaming and tells everything to him.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:48.720
His mother, screaming, confesses to him for everything that has been happening and everything that the guy has been

00:10:48.720 --> 00:11:01.320
doing to him. His mother calls the police and the police instruct Drake to make

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.200
a call to Brian to get a confession out of him because yes. No, they weren't going anywhere,

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.160
it's something that, as you can understand and as he describes in the documentary itself,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.640
it's a call that he didn't like and that cost him a lot of work, but obviously

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:21.960
the police had their point if Drake simply took it for granted. denounce without any evidence

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:27.000
or anything like that because not only was he not going to get the guy condemned

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.440
or anything like that but he was publicly capable of media and the guy complicated his

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:42.800
life man like that first I'll tell you that if not would have had the confession and this guy gives this guy for

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:48.080
going out publicly or for reporting him at work or whatever basically they would have kicked him out of the

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:59.680
job [Music] there is a surprise Okay and there is one thing that both confirm and that is

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.840
that after the arrest of guy The only one he confessed everything to was Dan

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.600
Sneider and apparently Dan behaved quite well with him, he supported him,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.760
he told him that he was there for whatever he needed and this for whatever reason I don't

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.720
know if there was behind this a good or bad intention but both confirm that this was the

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:35.960
case on his part drey recovered the relationship with his father to whom at first he did not tell him that

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:41.800
it had been abuse but first he told him that it had been an attempted abuse, imagine not

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.320
the mother's face after learning this whole story after they kicked

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.240
the father who was there fighting over his son who suspected from the first moment that

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.600
there was something there that wasn't right and they kicked him They gave the man the displeasure of

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.760
not continuing to represent his son and also the distancing, accusing him of something he

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.800
had not done and the mother having trusted Brian by letting this guy take her son everywhere

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.840
and keeping him at home. Go to sleep, go to the mother. She would have a small trauma. The

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:16.240
regret she still has to have to this day has to be brutal. I probably didn't even let her

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.480
sleep. Yesterday, I told you at the end of the video, but I'll highlight it again. This man was convicted, Brian.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:27.360
pak now we will see how the sentence was but publicly no one knew who the victim had been

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.040
people knew that this guy was convicted but they did not know that Drake Mall was his victim who

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.880
had been abused by him obviously people on the team apart from dan sneider part of the The Nickelodeon team

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:44.720
did know what had happened and they knew that Drake was the victim but no one talked about it.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.600
They respected Drake's decision and Brian Pak's case because it was not a media scandal because even though

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.640
he was a fairly well-known guy in Hollywood since his victim was supposed to be

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:01.560
anonymous Well, at the time the news came out and little has been given as much hype as, for example,

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.000
the years that they have been talking about the subject of Dan Sneider or, for example, about Harvey Wasting, which I

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.480
believe is the complete scandal is not the seal of the complete scandal in Hollywood and now comes a

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:16.360
part of the video that is going to make you very sick and it is something that perfectly reflects the business world.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.040
We have seen many similar things, for example on a smaller scale in the world of any

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:26.840
type of business in the world of youtubers on another scale in the world of cinema as well or of

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:32.280
television series, similar things have probably also happened and Brian Pak,

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:37.320
despite having been convicted, received the support of many colleagues and actors from the

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:54.960
profession and even from large companies like Disney, yes Disney Disney Channel hired

00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:01.600
him again after being sentenced to 16 months in prison and being on the registry

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.520
of sexual abusers because apparently in the United States the people who are

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.360
convicted For this type of crimes, they remain as if they were on a list, not the same

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:14.360
as your criminal record, because that mark remains, no, and Disney hired him again,

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:31.720
that is, to start with, several employees of Hollywood actors such as, for example,

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:38.200
celebrities like J mar, the Sonic the movie actor and many others sent letters to the

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:44.480
judge asking for clemency and that affected him being only sentenced to 16 months in prison.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.680
[Music]

00:15:50.680 --> 00:16:02.520
These people arrived in prison in letters in which they asked for clemency for this abuser, going so far

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:07.680
as to say that surely the 15-year-old boy made many provocations to him and that is

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.720
why this man lost his mind and fell into the fact that they were longing to return to work with

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:24.920
him, regrettable, disgusting, the business world, man, I mean, I understand it

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.400
perfectly on many occasions and it works like this in almost all

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:34.040
sectors, but hearing this or, well, more than hearing it, seeing the letters literally is

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:44.080
disgusting, it is for [ __ ] a each one of those who have written one of these letters to each of

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:49.960
the actors and to any company that would hire the guy again and literally make him the

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:58.840
media cross

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.200
. In other words, all these guys are the ones who later appear at the woke party, they give you a Little Mermaid

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.880
and a Blanc Snow black because they are very progress and then they have this is that it sends eggs sends

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:34.640
[ __ ] What a great idea we are not talking about children eh We are no longer talking about any

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.520
abuse of any mistake that someone makes in life not that No,

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.960
we're not talking about children. The best idea is Disney to hire a guy who has been

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:49.320
convicted of something related to children and have him produce a children's series. Not the best idea on the

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:58.840
planet.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.880
I hope they never put the same people in. who made this decision to hire, for example,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.840
child minders, not daycare managers, because I can think of a few examples that

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:15.840
I'm not going to put here because they would be too unfortunate, but what a joke, no. I mean, what a

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:25.640
joke

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:33.520
, we haven't mentioned it yet, but Drake Mall was involved a few

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:39.000
years ago in a conviction, that is, he was convicted because he was caught chatting inappropriately with a

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:51.480
minor. Yes, a person who was a victim of abuse almost became an

00:18:51.480 --> 00:19:03.200
abuser, a theory that I have in my head and it runs out of me. comes to mind when I saw

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.560
this guy saying that for whatever reason he was so willing to work with Drake and collaborate with him

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.360
in justice, not after the things that have been said about him, not but a theory that I have

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:17.840
in my head is that Drake has come out now, that is, always throughout his youth, even though

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:23.000
Brian was convicted and so on, he has kept quiet, that is, he has never wanted to say that he was the victim for

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.840
whatever reason, for his privacy or whatever, and now suddenly He comes out and tells it. What need did he have when it

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:34.360
came to telling it? For me, there are two options that have paid him a lot for this documentary and two

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:39.160
that I obviously think are the closest that he has come out now to tell it and to present himself as

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.760
a victim of abuse, which he is for clean up his image from what he has done a few

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:51.200
[Music]

00:19:51.200 --> 00:20:05.560
years ago in 2020 10 years after breaking up his relationship with her he was also accused of abuse And

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:11.680
this girl Melisa linga fet accused him of both verbal and physical abuse at the level of

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:17.120
throwing things at her, dragging her down the stairs, beating her badly in her

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:23.880
Instagram stories without mentioning it but everyone understanding who she's going for I don't really care If

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:29.200
Any believes me as This is my story my life and something that I went through it wasn't

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.080
recently until That I actually realized that abuse isn't something that all women have to

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:39.440
go through I moved in with him I was singing it wasn't until about a year When the verbal

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.840
abuse started and When I say verbal abuse Imagine the worst type of verbal abuse you

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:52.120
could Ever Imagine and that was what I got um It then turned into physical hitting throwing

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:58.600
Everything at the pinnacle of it he drugged me down the stairs of Our house in the fiz My

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.920
Drake came out a few weeks later and she denied it, stating that everything this girl had said

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.840
was absolutely false and that she had completely made it up. My opinion, I don't know

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.400
what you think, put me in the comments box, what you think,

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.040
what I think here is that it would be typical. toxic relationship in which both of them would surely fight

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:25.400
the profile of the girl Pichi picha and I what I think these two would yell at each other maybe

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.920
they would hit each other whatever but it would be mutual we are talking about people who were very corg

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.600
that they were dragging traumas of Little Ones And well, I'm already seeing all the stories that

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.240
They are dating And how they all end up in their youth Let's remember Amanda Bines' accusations

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:45.040
on Twitter in 2012 against Dan For me the strongest is this one here A man in

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:51.560
particular took hundreds of photos of my feet I was 13 years old and that is one of The main reasons

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.880
why I don't want to get pregnant I think it has been more than proven and we showed

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.800
a few things in the previous video that this man really liked checking feet and he

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:04.160
was not a shoemaker, which is true, I don't know what What explanation do you give me? Maybe it's

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.560
a culture shock. What does the fact that a person has taken photos of your feet or many

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:14.120
photos of your feet when you were 13 years old mean that today you don't want to get pregnant? I don't

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:18.320
understand this. tets have not been mentioned in the documentary for some reason that I don't know

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.240
because when you make a documentary the thing is that you put all the information that is well

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:27.320
documented That's why the word documentary but for whatever reason the tweets don't appear,

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:32.000
I don't know if they have appeared too strong Although it doesn't make sense either, I don't know if

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.200
maybe they don't give it credibility because they took away the girl's Twitter account and then

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:41.800
another one was opened to post more tweets, but what they do talk about is that Dan tried to emancipate Dan. The girl, so

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.120
that her parents don't control her money, that this is something they give, gives the following

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:58.440
explanation

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.400
Which included her lawyer her agent her manager her publicist me She included me as part of her

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:17.920
Team thought of Me that way we supported her tried to getem am still the fact that this guy

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.760
has come out to apologize on YouTube and show his face and break his silence as if he were

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.760
any youtuber when he screws up is something that still seems like a fantasy to me and they have to

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.800
explain it to me that video doesn't want What did you think? He wants you to listen to it but he doesn't want me to give

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:37.120
my opinion. He has disabled the comments so it is impossible to comment on the YouTube video

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:42.760
and with a little program I have managed to see the dislikes he has and at the moment I am recording

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:50.280
This video surpasses the 34,000 dislikes so people are not buying this story eh but

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:55.120
the interview still seems very prepared to me I don't know if this is a boomer thing but if

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.400
they think that this has been natural it hasn't worked, that is, it hasn't worked super

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:04.920
prepared questions on the part of the interviewer also the expressions and so on not like he is super

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:11.800
prepared no inent Where She Had ran away from home exactly What happened in that situation Yes

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:16.360
Uh One night It was very late well after Midnight One or two in the morning phone rang I answered

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.640
It was Amanda She was upset She was in distress She Had some conflict with her parents I thought

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.680
her Father and She called me I was immediately concerned about her safety I called someone Who

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.360
I knew was fairly nearby that person was able to go and Pick her up I knew She was

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.400
Although it is true that we must recognize that many things She has admitted and for some

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.200
she has apologized, well less than a stone about Jenet Macardy that you are asking me to

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.480
make the complete video about this girl and I'm still thinking about it because I don't know

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.880
how I'm going to be able to pronounce his last name so many times with how badly I even pronounce

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:55.000
Spanish. Let's remember that Janette accused him of workplace abuse of yelling at her and massaging her without

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.320
permission.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.680
Regarding this, the response of and the explanation he gives

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.760
, along with apologies, is that he is simply

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:23.040
sorry for everyone who has had to undergo

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:28.320
a massage but that it was part of his personality. And today he wouldn't do it.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.080
I don't know what you think about this. The truth is that I'm looking forward to reading

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:40.720
the comment box and seeing what you think about this explanation and if you miss his

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:47.920
apologies the people who were Walking around video Village or Wherever they happen Because

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:53.960
there W Lots of people there Who witnessed it Who also May have felt uncomfortable so I ow them to

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:59.280
see the truth is that it could happen that the guy has that personality that is a stupid person

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.640
you already know that there are many people who are like that who are talking to you and they are touching you

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.560
no and they touch your belly and The spies touch you, they touch your side, they even grab your hand.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.960
face when they are talking to you but of course I think that the guy is creepy because it is not the issue of giving

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.720
massages to minors because in addition to that you are dealing with minors but rather that he had

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.240
other types of behaviors such as the issue of feet prohibiting people from wearing shoes

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.600
in the studio that in the end is a fetish that wouldn't have anything wrong if it weren't for the fact that

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:31.560
you are working with children for you let's speak directly to the people who did not have a good

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:37.000
experience with you ok I would like to speak to those people Because I hate that anybody worked

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.320
for me and didn't have a good Time I would Let that pressure get to me Which a good Boss should

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:45.760
Never Ever do there specific things that You were doing sure I would um Snap at people sometimes I

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.680
would be snarky When I could have given them a nicer answer I would not Give people the time

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.760
that they needed I would be in too Big a hurry to get on to the next Thing I Had to do and

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.240
watching that show it made me there were so many times I wanted to pick up a phone and

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:09.200
call someone

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.880
I was very impressed by the fact that by the way he

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:18.000
has also given an explanation about this and I believe the explanation but pay attention because this is

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:33.000
crazy What do you think of that all these jokes that You're speaking of um that the Show covered

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.320
Over The last two Nights Every One of Those jokes was written for a Kid audience Because

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.320
Kids thought they were funny and only funny Looking Back at them 20 years later through

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.800
their lens and they're Looking at them and they're saying you know I don't think That's

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.280
appropriate How anyone feels let's Cut Those jokes out of the Show Just like I would have

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:54.600
done 20 years ago or 25 years ago I Cut it I want my shows to be popular I want Cut Cut and

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.080
it's something that if you think about it makes complete sense and here Yes, I believe that this would be the case, that

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:04.200
is, the ideas were his, but there were more filters, no. In other words, there were

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:09.080
more people above him who were approving those contents and those contents were published after

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:15.280
passing through a few filters that also approved that content. content there were many many levels

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:28.120
ofru we Had execu in Had execu in New York warding about Sound sets dial jokes are boss

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:34.080
not by Dan's justification that is still disgusting I mean imagine

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:38.480
justifying yourself in that Ah the idea was mine I am a shady No, I'm a creepy but

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.360
it was published because they approved it, which means that they agreed with what

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.880
I was doing. So, the others are also creepy, I am one, but the others

00:28:45.880 --> 00:29:02.280
also m here what I What makes me think is that the world is about cinema or that the hatred that was

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.960
a posh, or what comes to mind is that this was a posh, another of the girls

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:12.480
who have denounced the sexualization of girls as an adult was Alexa Nicolas, who was talking about how she

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:18.680
was required to wear a skirt, the shorter the better, since her character was made to bring the

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:33.920
boys along, she told her character in I'm 101

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:46.960
to wear very short skirts. Nicole Briston, I had to wear very short skirts, something that in the interviews that What I have done and what I haven't

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.560
mentioned yet is that I had to wear biker shorts under the skirts and

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.960
they had to cut the biker shorts because the skirts were too

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:02.640
short eh From here the coolest thing is not like they have short skirts but that they took photos

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:08.960
of the girl and Daner asked the photographer for the photos to keep according to the story of this

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:27.960
girl

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:45.440
who, by the way, br's sister is amazing, she eh And lastly, something

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.480
that has also been reported that no longer has anything to do with it with the

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.320
sexual sphere but with the issue of having endangered the kids in the program Fear

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:57.920
Factor [Applause]

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:13.640
which was basically a program of challenges, today it would be something similar to the

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:21.000
Reset Channel or the Cabrera Channel they did to the kids did challenges that were really

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:32.200
bad because also at that time there were not many special effects and

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.200
so on, but what they were doing, what you are seeing on the screen,

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:43.120
[Applause]

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:56.360
they did, the truth is that we cannot deny that they were in a world where the adults who

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:04.560
They surrounded them had strange and uncomfortable fantasies. Family, we will see how this escalates. The truth

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.840
is that things were already murky because this is a case that has been talked about for a long time

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:14.360
now, but with this latest documentary and the new testimonies that are coming out it's

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:19.880
getting dark little dark I read you in the comment box always with respect Please don't
