00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
I saw some that do talk about current events, it's one thing to talk about current events and another thing is for you to report, so for me reporting is like giving the news super objectively, not like maybe what I would do on the salcería or cell on their main channel but

00:26:21.659 --> 00:26:23.029 align:start position:0%
So it hasn't been like a bit, I

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.149 align:start position:0%

00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%

00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
put gossip channels there and they
 

00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:33.409 align:start position:0%
put gossip channels there and they

00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:35.269 align:start position:0%
