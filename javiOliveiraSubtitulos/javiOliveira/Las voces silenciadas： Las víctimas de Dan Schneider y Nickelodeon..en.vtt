It is Our Great honor to present the First Ever Nickelodeon lifetime achievement award

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.280
to a man who's been making All of Us laugh For the past two decades dan

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.000
Schneider Come on Give Up the

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.840
Juice you want to get slapped with the sausage

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:33.440
sure to say ni things about Cuz I will tase her If necessary

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.320
That's going to get on TV That's going to get on

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:54.720
TV Why are you sitting on the floor of the set be essentially

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.920
tortured

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:29.920
Oh

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.000
yes, what we just saw in the intro is very shady, we are not going to deny it but it is even murkier

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.880
after knowing that these things that you have just seen were seen on television and that

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.400
many more things happened behind the camera for two decades, surely many of the

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.240
things that we are going to review in this video many of you have seen when They were broadcast but

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.440
since you were children or teenagers Well, maybe you didn't see it with evil and for any

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.600
kid Maybe it went unnoticed to realize the seriousness of the matter behind these

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.200
scenes in the early 2000s Nickelodion was the most beloved network By both children and

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.600
young people, their cartoons were the most watched during the day, the ones with the largest audience,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.400
even completely eating up Cartoon Network and the Disney Channel

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.040
itself. Teen comedies were becoming

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.480
more and more relevant. You will surely remember shows like Clarisa Kenan and Kel or Drake and Jos, which is a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.520
series that will certainly gain a lot of importance at the end of this video. So I invite you to

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.120
stay until the end. I am going to talk to you about a guy who is currently unpunished a guy who has been

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.000
accused on numerous occasions of child abuse and behaving in a very shady manner with

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.920
minors, abusing power because he was Nickelodeon's most important producer for

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.760
many years in the golden age dan sneider es a producer, screenwriter, director and writer

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.680
who came to Nickelodeon in 1993. He previously had a career as an actor in the mid-

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.800
80s where he played some supporting roles in films, the best known and most

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.640
remembered being Ricky in the film Better of the One. comes to translate better dead if you want

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.440
a preview and ask me what is my opinion regarding this guy I would clearly describe him

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.000
as the title I gave to this video the Nickelodeon Predator a guy with

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
disgusting feelings towards the girls he worked with and that he had a certain taste for feet and I'm not

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.320
referring to refrigerator ice cream, his last post on Instagram is a posthumous message to Mafi Perry,

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.840
that is, Cherle, for his friends and never Better said after his death, remembering that he starred in

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.080
a comedy with him early 90s before he came to his very famous series

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.680
Schneider whose stories of alleged sexual abuse of minors and abuse of power for having

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.600
that position on the very famous television network is coming to light through a new documentary

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.320
that is being broadcast right now. While you're watching this video I think they're on

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.120
about the second episode And so far what we have is a bomb And what do you want me to tell you? I

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.160
greatly respect the presumption of innocence. This guy has had four

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.200
convicted pedophiles working with him on his team. and he has not been convicted at the moment, some of the actresses who

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.360
have worked on the network claim that it is because of the power it has, not with the justice system but with shutting up

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.560
mouths, but really the things that we are going to see in this video simply with the scenes that You have

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.560
seen in the intro the things he does to the boys and especially to the girls. I think

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.120
they are more than enough to think that this guy would surely be on Jeffrey Esting's list.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.440
Get comfortable and pay attention to the video at the 1988 Kid Choy Awards. He meets a

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.800
Nickelodeon employee named Alv Hit who would end up being president of the network and being hired

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.160
here. I really feel like taking a break to point out this marriage, or really,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.040
surely this one? Madam, you have more context of the story and you know many more clues than us

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.800
and you will have seen many more scenes than we are going to see in this video. How is it possible

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.280
that you are still married to this day? You just reminded me and I can't think of anything else. that

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.440
Jlin Maxwell putting up with everything Jeffrey Epstein did and covering up his moves. Really, if you

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.640
know 10% of the context and the things that have come out of this guy, it is very unlikely that she will want

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.400
to continue not being married to him but deleting all your history of what you have experienced with him in

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.400
recent years and perhaps decades some very strong rumors and accusations have been made about dan

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.680
sneider accusations on social networks of some actors and anonymous confessions have caused

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.440
dan's name to be questioned in some forums and networks such as Twitter and in some books without

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:55.000
naming him directly but making the allusion very clear, they have accused him of alleged labor abuse,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.440
alleged sexual abuse, fetishism and even mistreatment and let us not forget all this

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.720
broadcast on television before everyone's eyes. the planet during the golden era of

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:13.360
cable television between 1996 and 2016 Nickel Odeion was the clear dominant, consistently surpassing

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.840
the titan Disney Channel itself and even Cartoon Network almost all the time,

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.760
creating a perfect combination between cartoons created by themselves and

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:31.720
teen comedies SpongeBob SquarePants Hey Arnold Jimmy Neutron among many others are

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.160
series that I'm 100% sure, even if you haven't seen any episode, I'm completely sure that

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.480
absolutely no one watching this video has ever heard any of these names

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.360
It especially competed with Disney Channel since it was in the fight with it, fighting

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.920
for the teenage audience, trying to bring to its network the same type of humor, the same type

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:56.160
of teenage series from which many artists of the day came out between the two networks. today

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.680
and well-known people like Miley saurus and no it is not a dinosaur called Miley tini in her

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.680
time Violeta sendall Ariana Grande who will have a lot of prominence in this video the formula that

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.280
always worked for the Channel and in most cases for many Of the boys who participated

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.760
in the series, acting in this type of show was fulfilling a dream, however, there was an exception

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:23.000
without anyone knowing Janette McCurdy. When we talk about this type of accusations from

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.160
such famous people, we obviously have to do it very carefully and be very cautious, we have seen on

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.600
some occasions, such as in the case of Michael Jackson, as they have always pointed out, of having

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:38.680
shady things and turning out to be innocent with people convicted today for defaming, however in

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.560
this case, unlike the case of Michael Jackson, quite the opposite, as the decades go by,

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.200
what comes out on the table is more and more evidence that is quite likely to be

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.880
true and that not even anyone is coming out to deny the truth, that is, this guy has not defended himself

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.560
on any occasion against At the time of none of the accusations that have been made against him, Michael Jackson

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:02.760
on any occasion even rejected judicial agreements that could have saved him headaches

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:08.440
to go to the end of the lawsuits and prove his innocence in fact to dan Schneider

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:13.880
have even gone so far as to link him with Harvey Wasin himself, who is currently convicted

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:19.440
of sexual assault, rape in the third degree and is sentenced to more than 30 years in

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.760
prison, has a sentence of 23 years and another of 16. They give what he did on his Twitter account in the

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.960
At the time when they began to link him to this director, what he did was delete any tweet

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:35.160
he had in relation to him and for some reason delete any publication he had on

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.600
Twitter related to feet. I think that no matter how much presumption of innocence we always want to have

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:45.120
for flag is more than evident that the foot fetish issue and You are going to see Many feet in

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.680
This video is not something that can be ruled out or hidden and that the guy has

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:55.120
shady behavior either to put you in context a little in case there is someone who is not able

00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.400
to perceive the power that a person like this has, we have to point out that this man has had

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:06.120
numerous successes on television in teenage series that we are talking about a Niche in

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.080
which it is not easy to succeed because it is a very specific audience and this gentleman has managed to have

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:17.480
series and episodes in them with more than 13 million viewers in its broadcast and then repeat the

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.440
episode at another time and have six more. We are talking about an outrage. We are talking about

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:28.280
the main television networks in my country. They have not had that even in the most golden thing

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:34.120
they have done in recent times is that I can't even tell you how many decades. I don't know if maybe in some

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.720
football thing at a World Cup or something like that, making series for teenagers between

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.840
13 and 16 years old is a very difficult challenge. The audience is kids who want to feel like adults. We have to.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.840
give them a little of that but you also have to be clear about the limits and try not to go overboard because

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:55.720
the people who watch the program are still minors, as I'm going to show you, Dan Sneider clearly

00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:00.280
went over them while the Nickelodeon series stood out for having more humor. acid its

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.880
competition More direct Disney Channel was betting on something whiter and it did not cross

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.280
that line even though Disney had quite successful programs, it was forced on some occasions

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.080
to plagiarize a little bit of a script, thereby bringing a constant clash between the two companies

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.360
in which they even threw what we call today on the internet as a bit of a steak.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.080
They have seen everything with Teri on Dingo Channel. No, it's disgusting because last night my brother was watching it and

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.720
they copied a segment of his show, what did one of the actors do? he pressed a button he heard

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.480
improvised jump they put on music a lot of lights and they started jumping like crazy it's exactly the same

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:39.280
as improvised dancing Well yes I noticed it they copied Carly they should do something about it yes

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.640
they should I hate dingo Channel shows it was common in the shows where This man

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.640
was in charge of watching some scenes with teenage girls who used to have very

00:11:48.640 --> 00:12:04.000
short pants Ariana Grande is surely the one with the strangest clips and what catches my

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.880
attention about her is not only that she has it, I understand that at the moment maybe You don't realize

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.120
the seriousness of what they are doing to you But as the years have passed, what

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:18.680
surprises me a lot is that this girl is one of the few who has not come out to report it, Dan discovered her

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.680
at the age of 13, she had her in a program and then he made her the protagonist of another, we are talking about

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.760
Dan Sneider's humor, in my opinion, as the years went by, it became more murky

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.680
and Ana Grande was right in this guy's last period as a director, so he had to The

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.840
most important thing is to tell me what you think of this click that I am going to put on the screen. Also in

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:43.480
this video I want to be very active in the chat and if you see double meaning in these words Or is it that

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:51.800
I am very poorly thought out soing W somebody bring me the oan no One Would Ever Say that Why Because if

00:12:51.800 --> 00:13:00.920
you soaking wet ands you want For To is More Than person Hey, I don't know, maybe they were

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.360
giving this script to this little girl because in the house where her character lived there was no

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.200
roof like I have already told you that this man has a certain attraction to feet and later in

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.280
the video you will see that it is common to see a lot of them. In his children's programs,

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.680
anything he found in the script that could serve as an excuse for someone

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.320
to you take off your socks and with that I could get a close-up of the pinreles I

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:31.880
took advantage of what I'm going to tell you next I don't even know how

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:42.680
to describe it and another one

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:57.840
as a father one of the first things that come to mind and I can't To prevent this from happening,

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.920
when this girl is recording these scenes, the parents are not there, that is,

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.840
we are literally talking about a minor. Parents are supposed to supervise their

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.360
children's work, and in the event that there is first a script, when this girl was reading the script

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.680
His mother hasn't even taken a look because I understand that when a person reads this script,

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.440
who probably has to describe even the gestures, he wouldn't think that he was talking

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.640
about a McDonald's potato. No, or that he was playing at removing Mr. Potato's ears.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.680
I don't want someone to explain to me the intention that the director of photography had when this girl was

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:34.120
doing poses like these to be broadcast, which must be repeated. It's okay to be broadcast on a

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:54.800
children's program, it must be said that most of these clips, the ones that are most controversial, are not They broadcast

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.000
directly on the television network but in some way they promoted it from

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.400
TV but published them on their website. I have not been able to verify at this time if perhaps

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:10.320
it was to attract an audience to the website because later within the website they sold some

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:15.160
type of product or whatever, which I imagine would be like that in the case of the series Victorious,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:20.200
the real reason why this series starring the

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.480
very famous Victoria Justice, who later continued with his career as an artist and

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:29.240
he is killing it, apparently in this case the closure had nothing to do with anything strange about

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:33.840
Dan Sneider as a producer and screenwriter, you know because of things with double meanings and this

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.640
type of things that we just saw, but more well because the actors were quite

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.480
revolutionized and were generating a lot of controversy and controversy outside

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:48.240
the series. What does this mean? Well, they were caught on several occasions having sex, apparently

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:54.240
not only off the set but in the dressing rooms in areas At work, let's

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:59.200
see, they are kids at a very bad age in which the hormones are at Flor's feet.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:04.360
They were even involved with drugs and things like that. In fact, even nudes

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:09.160
of victories were leaked and this. Well, look at the network, you don't have any scruples. apparently not to the network

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.480
because she was not happy that Victoria had leaked nudes out there on the internet, if there was

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.680
any attractive photograph, she preferred to give it to the director, but well, apart from the joke, I suppose

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:23.160
that being Nikelodio on a children's network in which I understand that there would be advertisers because it was not the

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.560
best idea for their actors and the protagonists of their series to be involved in this

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.040
type of media controversies when we talk about sex, drugs and alcohol,

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:58.840
surely

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.600
I already told you that this decision surprises me taking into account that, for

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.440
example, the director He put them in situations like this one that you will see in the following

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.480
clip in which he used the excuse of a resuscitation so that the two teenagers

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:34.280
could make out but What does that have to do with action Ok well II lost my cellone Can you please help me

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:45.640
cheers pch he was really Giving me Mouth to Mouth resuscitation right was a Blue pair

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.120
phone the new one And I know I Had it When I was buying a pretzel but I just I don't

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:58.840
remember sir I think It's Great that you are a Uh

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.040
control them When I was 13 years old I still had a pass But as the kids

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.800
grew up and approached their twenties it was completely impossible and as I already

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:29.640
told you they ended the series Yes, Dan wanted to keep Ariana Grande with whom he had a

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:36.040
great relationship and the very famous series of Sam and Cat arrived, starring Ariana Grande and Janette

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:42.960
Macardy. Parenthesis, I'm making an effort and I've done it. While I was preparing the video

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.800
to review well how the names are pronounced, I'm probably going to slip up in some of them, but for my

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:54.400
effort I deserve it. your like Give it to him handsome jette macardi was one of the first to accuse dan

00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.440
of abuse the book he released in 2022 was very viral both on Amazon and in all bookstores

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:05.120
and there was a lot of talk on the internet about the subject also in television shows it was bestseller of

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:10.720
non-fiction books and the second best seller on Amazon, surpassing even novels by Colen

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:16.240
Huber. In reality, it would be great to tell you a little about the context of this girl's story and

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.960
the hard life she had before she suffered these alleged abuses. work that

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:27.280
she tells in that book because the girl has a context of a very complicated life, a mother who

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:34.240
becomes very crazy, mistreats her throughout her life and it is a tremendous, very shady thing that she

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:39.280
If you want me to make another video, ask me in the comments box and if I see that this one

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.440
has a lot of support and that you ask me a lot in the comments and the comments where you ask me for it,

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.880
you have a lot of support, I do it okay because it really is for another separate video because otherwise

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.400
this one would be on me in two hours but in short, a mother who mistreated her, a

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:59.040
mother who also had a certain trauma with her daughter not growing up and tried to

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:04.840
stop her physical development through food. Eh, I'm referring to the physical development so that the girls

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:11.040
would continue to be called from children's series, it ended up causing anorexia bulimia, the girl ended up

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:16.520
fatally okay, that is, the girl ended up fatally because of her mother and the little point was the director who

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.960
had in the series that catapulted it to success, we are talking about a series with so much success that even

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:27.800
Michelle Obama herself, some famous models, presenters, Emma Stone, a lot of

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.880
celebrities from the elite of North America have had their cameo in this series due to the popularity it

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.840
had, focusing on this video. in what jenette says about dan in this book in which she never

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.600
names him. By the way, every time she refers to him she calls him the creator, which is a way of calling him

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.520
in which it is clearly understood that it goes to him not only because of the context and because of the story, which

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.600
is more than evident, but because in previous interviews he had already called him that To prepare

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:55.560
people He states things that could belong to the field of labor abuse, such as suddenly

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.560
this gentleman's mood changes the same thing one day Endo was telling her that she was the best actress

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.480
in the world and the next day he was yelling at her and yelling at her because she was doing her job Bad.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:09.000
Even that could basically happen because it could be an episode of a bad day, I don't know, it's not to

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
justify it But it's not What's serious, what's serious is this. Not at one of the dinners, the man approached her

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.040
while she was commenting on the derivative project and touched her knees without authorization. Macardy recalled

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:25.800
that this touch gave her cold chills and when he realized it, he asked her if she had cold and then

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.800
covered her with his coat while he placed it on her shoulders. The creator patted her

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.320
shoulders, which became a massage. He felt the ground and ended up giving her a

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:40.520
face massage that, more than relaxing her, made her tense and on alert. But she couldn't stop him because

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.920
she was afraid that he would be offended. One important thing we have to say about Jenet's relationship

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:50.120
with Dam was that he had promised her on several occasions that at some point she would get

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:55.840
a series in which this role would be the protagonist. The protagonist never arrived and here we come to the

00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:01.120
series Sam and Cat in which not only was she not the only protagonist but her partner

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:06.680
with whom she co-starred in the series was none other than Ariana Grande, who was already

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.680
warm from Victorius, her popularity was increasing, we are talking about a girl who

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.600
was exploiting and also had talent in music. She has already confessed on many occasions that

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:22.040
she was jealous of Ariana and the relationship between the two became more and more complicated. She

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.240
was jealous because Ariana She had certain privileges, for example, when she had another musical commitment,

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:32.200
they even changed the script of the series and stated that her character was not around or

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:36.240
was locked in a room, something about which, for example, she complained that they did not do

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:41.200
the same with her. When she got another job that coincided with the recording of the series, she had to

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:46.280
reject the other job. I really don't see anything out of this world. I see this as normal.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:51.280
In the end, the company wanted to keep Ariana Grande, who was the musical star of the young people

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:56.280
of the moment and we are talking about a top artist who The later he leaves, the better for the

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:01.600
network, according to Jannette, the straw that broke the camel's back for her to burst with jealousy is that one day

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.960
Ariana Grande arrives at the studio commenting that he's been out last night playing charades

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:12.280
at tom's house HK from then on i didn't like him i couldn't like the success of a

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:17.600
pop star i could handle it but hanging out with sheriff bodyy with fucking forest

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:22.200
gum This had gone too far, I swear, when I read this sentence I think it's a joke.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.920
but not really, the bad vibes between the two were palpable in the atmosphere according to

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:33.400
people magazine, the series that you 35 chapters was canceled since the work environment between Jenette and

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:38.960
Ariana was completely unsustainable and after Ariana decided not to continue in a new

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.800
season the series was canceled here you have the tweet with which Ariana Grande said goodbye to the

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:48.400
audience of the series I am not going to read it for obvious reasons a lot of text ok I am going to pass it

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.600
down like this in case you want to stop the video and want read it yourself but let's go basically here

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:57.000
what catches my attention is that he says goodbye to the entire team he says goodbye to the entire audience he says

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.880
goodbye to dan having nice words for him but he doesn't make any mention of his partner the co

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:07.640
-star of the series and It is not precisely because the tweet does not fit. This is what is

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.120
called a longer tweet. Previously, when Twitter Blue was not paid, it was a thing that

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:17.000
was used so that you could post a very long tweet. Come on, it was a link and you wrote the

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.840
long one . text within the link, according to Janette, the program's production team

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:28.440
offered her 300,000 so that she would never speak again about the mistreatment and alleged abuses that

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.400
she had suffered while she had been working with them, something that Jenes did not agree

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:39.040
with and he didn't accept the money what the hell or that the deon is offering me 0000,000 in money so

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:44.040
that I don't speak publicly about my experience on the program my personal experience of the

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:50.280
creator's abuse This is a network with programs made for children they shouldn't have any type of

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:55.760
moral compass, shouldn't they at least try to report some type of ethical standard, the most controversial thing about

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:02.240
their book is the headline I'm glad my mom died but I'm telling you, it's so much of a topic that it gives me for

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.640
another video So if you want it Proving it to me, the Ariana Grande thing that I already told you, makes me

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.160
very nervous. The truth is that I don't understand this girl's reaction and once she has nothing to do

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:17.320
with Nickelodion, I don't know if it's out of gratitude because they are the ones who catapulted her and the that

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:22.680
they have given her the showcase so that she is where she is today but basically Well, before working

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:27.760
with them she had like a lot of spam tweets trying to get the attention of the creator of

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:32.440
Dan snake neider And well, not only that but she had a lot of affectionate tweets with him

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:38.760
Already working at the network, in fact in 2017 he asked Dan to see if he could bring together the casting

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:43.160
of the Victorius series to make a special Something to which Dan responded that it was in them

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.400
and that he would try and that he would do everything possible and well, she followed him on her Twitter account until the

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.880
day she deleted the account on her Instagram account, we can see that she continues to follow him and I'm

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:57.080
telling you, I imagine it will be as a thank you But I don't understand this defense but neither for her nor

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:03.800
by his colleagues A manda vines was the first victim of dan sneider his show his program was his

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:09.400
first success as a writer and as a producer he discovered her doing comedy in an audition and since

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:16.520
then he had his eye on her and knew that the girl would be a star we are speaking of 1998 and in '99

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.680
he created a series for her where she was the star, in fact the program even had her name and he spent

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:28.760
a lot of time with her because as he said they shared the same type of humor and got along very well the

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:39.520
deting up Heaven Looking down saying I think her a challenge dan Saw her and like immediately knew

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:44.760
she'd be a Star he recognizes her Talent and he wants her on all that immediately

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:49.160
mea

00:26:49.160 --> 00:27:03.320
you Yes H to I think win rare rare to say the least she even tried to emancipate herself from her

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:09.080
parents to not having to ask their permission to make any agreement that arose with Dan,

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.040
however, over the years, when she grew older and had a

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:18.440
lot of problems, she ended up involved in drugs and ended up with mental problems. The girl ended up in

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.840
a state of Similar to what happened to Britney, but I'm talking to you about a state of

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:27.360
mental health that when they declare that everything, including your decisions, is handed over to your

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.920
guardians, the girl even caused a fire in the middle of the street, that is, the girl Lio

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:37.400
písac level britne p so that you understand me very similar everything in fact almost the same and of

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:42.080
Suddenly, apparently, she began to realize all the abuse that, according to her, she would have suffered

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:48.360
from Dam. From her Twitter account, she would have published things like this. Give me one and I

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:55.160
will give you a show. Sneider, see me and I will put you in Nikelodion, that is, they fixed it What she says in

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.520
the tweets is also directly mentioning Dan's last name, that is,

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.920
she is pointing it out directly. They took away her Twitter account. I think the parents wanted to avoid

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:08.640
legal problems or something like that and she created another account again where she posted similar things

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:14.880
. many rumors in Hollywood some real and some false one man in particular took hundreds

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:20.360
of photos of my feet I was 13 years old and that is one of the main reasons why I don't want

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:25.120
to get pregnant Maybe this time he is not mentioning my last name dan dan sneider

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:30.080
but who do you think these tweets are alluding to, most likely the weirdo with the

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:52.960
feet nurses these Kid Feet Hello This is dan Schneider aka dan warp on Twitter

This girl that you are seeing on the screen is called Alexa Nicolás and she is one of the actresses of Soy 101.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:32.600
This girl accused Dan that Dan made her model in his cting and in the tests with skirts that were too

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.800
short, so short that the shorts that she wore you know that sometimes when

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:42.360
girls put on a miniskirt, to keep everything under control, they put on shorts underneath because

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:46.920
I said that these shorts even had to be cut so that they wouldn't show how

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.560
short the skirts actually were. Here I will be putting a text on the screen of

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.560

has also reported episodes of bullying by her colleagues in the series and that Dan allowed it and

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:21.560
Dan's and Nickelodeon's lawyers contacted the girl and her family in 2019

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:34.560
at the beginning of the video, Dan had hired three men in his work team at the network

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:40.880
who were convicted of pedophilia and even when accusations and suspicions began to arise, Dan

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:46.040
Schneider continued to keep him on his team, he is the case for example of this man Jason Michael

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:51.880
handy this pedophile assistant of dan sneider's production team made friends with

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:57.840
