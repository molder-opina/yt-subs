00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.200
Didi in prison in prison and it also looks like it's going to be difficult for him to get out

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.240
of there if news comes out, surely very pleasant and long-awaited for many people,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.680
I'm going to tell you in this video all the details of why. Finally They have decided

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.920
to put him in without the possibility of saliva or bail or anything like that. And in addition, the experts

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.920
would point out that even Moreno can be removed from the time that the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.440
shadow is going to hit. On this channel, you have a whole playlist with everything the story, we have been following

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.840
the case for a long time, I recommend that you watch it if you want to find out everything

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.080
and not lack details, but more or less in this video we are going to remind you of almost all

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.440
the things. You are going to have context of everything that is happening. From the raid on

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.800
his house signs of sex trafficking his shady relationship with Justin Bieber abuse of women and

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.440
minors assaults even suspicions of murder Now it turns out that this man who has

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.080
scared so many people claims to be suffering abuse in prison and that he is afraid

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.000
So he wants to be transferred or finally released after all the accusations

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.320
and suspicions that were surrounding him. Padi has been arrested and is currently in a

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.880
Brooklyn jail. He has tried twice this week to appeal to get bail

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:29.920
. but the judges say that nanay that there is a risk of flight and that he does not come out of the Hole

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.506
[Applause]

00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:34.833
[Music]

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:37.160
[Music]

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.640
padad at the moment is not convicted of anything he has been investigated for a long time as

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.640
you all know from the day of the raid on his mansion But he has been detained as a precautionary measure

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.000
due to the risk of being lost, I mean lose and not escape because this guy has a private Jet, he has

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.760
mafias everywhere, that is, this guy could do whatever he wants, disappear from the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.000
planet surely enough time for things to calm down or prescribe and that is what

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.440
money has, a lot of power. He has appealed trying to get out on bail, offering first

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.040
50 million dollars and then 100 and the judges say that nana and even now it is decreed that

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.680
there would be a risk of suicide, comparing his case a little with that of Jeffrey Epin and they have put him in

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.800
a special cell with anti-preventive measures without access to anything with which he can try to even

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.200
harm himself. Likewise, I highly doubt the idea of ​​wanting to take one's own life. I would rather

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.440
advocate because this guy is going to try to move heaven and earth to get him out of there because he is

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.760
used to it and has been used to solving things the way he wants with a blow

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.840
of money, a blow of threats and things like that all his life. the memo style refers to or concerns your office eh

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.080
the security of coms While you are in custody considering what happened with epen we are concerned about the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.720
safety of any person detained before a trial it is part of our obligation to ensure

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.200
their safety This is contemplated in the criminal justice system but I would not establish

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.800
any correlation between Jeffrey Hsin's and what may not happen with other defendants before

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.960
trial Of course the decision on detention will depend on a judge our position

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.280
is that in this case it is justified preventive detention, it must be said that in part this type

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.440
of measure is usually something common in cases with such high media coverage and with characters as dangerous as

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.440
this one. In fact, I already told you, Didi's lawyer says that his client has no thoughts of

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.120
taking his own life or He has crossed his mind and they are trying to fight to get him out of

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.080
that cell because he doesn't want to be in that cell and well, what's up my kids, welcome one more day to

Channel let's get to the mess one of the most controversial issues surrounding Pat Daddy has been his relationship with

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.440
Justin Bieber you already know that For a long time we have been commenting on a viral clip on

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.360
the good pat Daddy makes some faces, he stayed with Justin for 3 days as if he were

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.040
some kind of tutor but a pretty shady tutor And we have also been commenting in

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.880
several videos on the strange relationship he has had that finally seems to have ended with rejection by

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.680
part of Justin Bieber and that he doesn't want to know anything about him to the point that he hosts him and doesn't

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.240
love him [__] or his phone. Now other new images have gone viral, for example

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.080
this video where Paz Dad tells him at one of his parties. gave alcohol to the kid, we're talking about

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.760
surely Justin Bieber in these images, at first glance Well, I don't think he's over

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.960
18, I think he's not even 18, but well, in the event that he was, I'm sure

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.360
he's not 21 and This is practically what it is said that Didi usually had

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:59.640
alcohol, drugs and participated very actively in the collapse of this kid's life

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040
[Music]

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.920
in fact look at this tweet that Juanito posted s Kim Potter was an ex-partner of Didi who

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.040
died a few years ago and on numerous occasions has recounted the Terrible episodes of abuse

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.760
she suffered at the hands of this bombshell Kim Potter claimed that Didi, her ex-partner, recorded tapes of him

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.160
having sex with Justin and that she sold those tapes to several Hollywood stars

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.040
. first line making millions of dollars with that now the million dollar question is who

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.040
are those celebrities who bought those tapes Wow How is this true eh Wow also in the

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.720
last week some new images that we had never seen

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.120
of the Didy's parties Like for example this one in which we can see how a guy ends up with his hair on

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:59.760
fire and Didi's friend says that well it is common for these things to happen at these parties

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.120
What's your

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:07.160

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.880
What put the

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:59.440
drink another one that I don't even know how to describe.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.920
Also, we must not forget that recently it is also about to see how the

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.440
actor Cuba ging is resolved, we were commenting on this channel also launched a lawsuit for abuse by

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.760
one of the producers of Didi, in which Didi participated in some way, was not

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.800
like he was putting pressure, what he does many times is like putting pressure, not like forcing

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.560
these things to happen, and I already believe that what was very definitive was not the end of the issue of video that

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.560
was leaked in the hotel kicking his ex-partner almost luckily in which he had no choice but to come out and

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.720
apologize, which obviously did not help much and that he asked for them because they were leaked because

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.040
in the mistreatment he was denying them until the moment he This video came out. Yes, it is true that

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:44.040
this case, which was from last year, that is, 2023, was finally resolved with an agreement, but it is

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.280
being taken into account in all the investigation that is now being carried out on Didi, so it

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.040
obviously has weight. and it hurts after that famous video sorry Didi tried to sell

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.800
the mansion that mansion in Los Angeles that everyone knows where the FBI raid took place for

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.240
70 million there is a lot of speculation about why he would be trying to sell this mention

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.480
because obviously I think He doesn't need money, there is talk that he has about 1 billion

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.200
dollars or something like that in property, I imagine that there will surely be much more.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.720
assets that are not known or that have it out there, but well, they talk about 1000 million

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.120
dollars, so I understand that 70, well, they are not in a hurry, there are many people who talk about how

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.640
they would be saving for the issue of trials, bail and those moves, but the The truth is that he was recently

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.800
seen with a new private jet worth 60 million dollars, that is, a little less than what he is

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.160
putting that mansion up for sale for, the private one is the [ __ ] [ __ ] I also tell you, I mean, how disgusting money

00:09:32.160 --> 00:10:00.400
there is another move that is being discussed less although I think that this is the one that

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.880
could be giving him the least headache And the thing is that down who formed a musical group with him

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:11.320
and the other girl at dinner is accusing him of having witnessed some quite complete physical attacks

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.480
by Didi aasi with her in front. So she saw it, the whole problem here is that

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:22.040
she or down mentions Kalena as a witness and cena is saying no, she hasn't seen

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.800
anything, therefore I understand that That lawsuit is going to come to nothing and Didi is going to win it. In other words, he is going

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.520
to practically archive it and another investigation that is underway in which

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.240
Elon Mask may be involved because It turns out that when Twitter was purchased, one of the 100 companies The one who

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.720
invested in this purchase could have been a Didi company, so they are looking at whether

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.920
Didi could be a partner in some way in this platform of this network phenomenon.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.360
There are obviously many stars who have spoken out against Didi, eminence, well,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.360
no. It's the first time, you already know that Eminen has declared war on Didi because he is

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.280
completely convinced that Didi had something to do with Tupac's death on

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.320
Eminen's last album. In fact, there are many references to Pat Dadi, things that can go to him as,

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.360
for example, repugnant that he would give him a beating like the one he has given to the ellipsis

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.200
regarding the issue of Tupac and the possible involvement of Didi, there is a new thing

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:13.160
that is being given a lot of truth and that is that the accused who is serving prison

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:18.000
for his death duan keev who was arrested last year for being accused of this homicide

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.800
stated that he killed him because he claims to have heard Daddy offer a reward to whoever made it

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.360
this statement has also been taken into account and is considered to be It is true that Paz Dad

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.320
in front of many people at a party offered a reward of up to 1 million dollars to whoever killed

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:39.800
Tupac and now it is being investigated how much is true and how much was involved so

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:45.120
who will be chosen after who will be next name the death of notorious Big was

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.440
the domino effect of Tupac's murder like a facial tissue who should clean the clock

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:56.240
next puff's until he's handcuffed by the police guilty will take a step forward

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.240
like hell he never turned himself in who knows all the innate murderers that there must have been And the fact is that

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.440
Didi's dwarfs do not stop growing in fact adria english a very famous porn actress is

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.480
also denouncing him and accusing him of sex trafficking she says that at first when she met

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.720
Didi he offered her boyfriend a job in 2004 because he was interested in working

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:21.800
with him and Didi proposed to him that she would give him a job if he agreed to perform oral sex on his girlfriend

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:28.080
and he on Didi, which I also tell you, eh there, it's also your fault a little for accepting the proposal, no.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:33.280
Although then finally It was thus given a job without the need for fellatio but in exchange for the

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.480
condition that Adria worked as a sexy entertainer at her parties. In other words, you can get an idea.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.920
When we talk about a sexy entertainer, we talk about Adria having to constantly

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.640
warm up the staff. At these Didi parties, they forced her to drink to be happy,

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:53.520
not to take drugs, and they also pressured her to have relationships with some guests. For example, they

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:59.360
talk about the owner of the jewelry store Jacob and company, which is a jewelry store that is well known among Eros

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.400
and some stars. from Hollywood, even Cristiano Ronaldo wears jewelry from this man,

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:08.160
he is practically known as The Jeweler of the Famous. Well, there are certain photographs that

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.800
are quite good, as you can see, compromising, in honor of the truth here and I don't know what you are going to tell me

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.480
but it's not like That Adriá looks uncomfortable is not what I'm telling you this proposal

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:24.320
She accepts because she feels like it, Didi's lawyer Jonathan Davis said earlier this

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:31.280
summer, no matter how many lawsuits are filed, that doesn't change the fact that Mr. Coms

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.480
has never sexually assaulted anyone, we live in a world where anyone can file a

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.000
lawsuit for any reason And without any evidence this past weekend padi was surprised

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.440
while he was at the door of the hotel where he was staying greeting some

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:58.280
followers Well after collecting all the evidence that the grand jury had and also

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:03.040
contrasting it with others Non-professional people in charge of validating the evidence and others

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:08.080
decided to proceed with the addi complaint for sex trafficking forced labor

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.360
Interstate transportation for the purposes of prostitution Cerón and incitement to practice prostitution

narcotics crimes kidnapping arson bribery and obstruction of justice in the

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.360
accusation it is said that Didi held sexual parties which I believe is no secret and he

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.560
directed them for These parties he also attracted women with pretexts such as having a romantic relationship

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:35.160
and then using force and blackmail to threaten them sexually even with one of

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:41.920
their colleges today I am Announcing a three-count indictment against Shan Coms for sex trafficking,

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:47.000

IP business empire to cover up criminal activities including sex trafficking

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.480
forced labor kidnapping fires and obstruction of justice and bribery the prosecution alleges

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:12.400
that coms abused and exploited women and others for years in multiple ways

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:19.280
force threatens strength and cohesion to force victims to consent to sexual activities with

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:25.040
prostitutes some who transported them from state to state he allegedly orchestrated activities

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.000
he called freaks and often recorded them electronically this sometimes

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.800
lasted several days involved multiple people engaged in prostitution and

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:41.360
often It included narcotics such as ecstasy and ghb among others. He did this so that the victims

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.600
would continue to obey him. It is noted that when Coms did not get his way, he became violent

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:51.400
and subjected the victims to physical, emotional and verbal abuse so that they would participate. He mistreated and sometimes

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.040
dragged the victims by pulling their hair on one occasion in March 2016. That behavior was

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:01.200
recorded on video and reported in the media. Specifically, he kicked, dragged, and threw a

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.240
glass at a victim in a Los Angeles hotel when the victim tried to escape, according to reports.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:11.200
points out that this often resulted in injuries to the victims that took days or weeks to heal.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:16.680
The investigation does not rule out that Didi had some necessary accomplices or collaborators

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:22.080
evidently paid to help him carry out all his misdeeds in the

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.520
March 16 incident at the Los Angeles hotel. Angeles that I prayed before a member of the Hotel security intervened and

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:33.240
hs tried to bribe him with a package of money to keep silent and as indicated in

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:38.000
the channeling in 2023 after public allegations Regarding the crimes of coms he and

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.160
others put pressure to witnesses and victims to remain silent, including making

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.800
phone calls to witnesses and victims and giving them a false narrative of what they had experienced. An

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.320
important point that is very important to me is that this accusation also details the elements

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.880
found in those raids, information that we did not have. to this day and

00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:01.760
things like various supplies for hallucinations, that is, drugs, drug trafficking, more

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:07.840
than 1000 bottles of lubricating oil for babies, yes, you have heard, well,

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.360
firearms were also seized, including three rifles like these that you are seeing in screen with number of

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:17.280
series deleted part of this investigation in March of this year special agents carried out

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.680
a raid on the residences of coms in Miami and Los Angeles they found and confiscated

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:27.840
firearms ammunition including three adulterated assault weapons as well as high-quality chickens

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:32.800
capacity electronic equipment with images and videos of the frico with multiple victims

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:38.320
and they seized boxes of the oil and personal lubricant that coms and his staff used in

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:43.560
These activities in total more than 1000 bottles 1000 bottles of lubricant uncle 1000 bottles of

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:48.320
lubricant Johnson you kid This guy left El Mercadona Dry. When he was captured for the first

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.520
time, the judge denied him bail despite being someone famous who cannot escape

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:58.200
easily. Well, I disagree with this because I think that this guy with the power he has just as

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:03.240
much sweats as be it someone famous at the end with money and all the stuff, that one or he has a private jet

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.960
or he can go wherever he wants, he has offered 50 million dollars to the justice system to get them to

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:13.120
leave him, they told him that it was na, then he offered 100 million in the appeal, eh, neither. I mean, they don't give him

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.440
conditional release, well, conditional release. No, they don't give him bail, which is what it's called,

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.440
which means that, well, right now, so you can understand, he's detained in jail so

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.520
he can't escape. He has not been convicted or anything. At the moment he is not convicted, okay. But as you see,

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:30.880
there is a high probability that he has committed all these illegalities and all these crimes and crimes

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:36.040
. Well, since he is a piece, well, basically, he also has the possibility of escaping whenever

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.360
he wants. Well, they have put him in jail not until this is resolved and there is a

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:45.760
trial and a sentence. Some experts affirm that the sentence would be between at least 15 years and

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.400
up to life imprisonment, or basically as it says here end of his career end of end of his life

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.720
practically although I tell you one thing eh and what I'm going to say is going to sound AB stupid but I think that's

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.560
how it is eh if the sentence is for example 10 years 15 years or something like that MMM I don't know or if it is the end of

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.960
his career definitively because here It seems that we live in a society in which even

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.480
criminals are often rewarded, they are given interviews on television, currently

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.600
it is not normal that bail is not granted, especially when it comes to a

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.640
figure public if it were a case that has nothing to do with things that are violent if there were no

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.080
allegations of drug use So since that does happen in this case, it is no longer something

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:26.600
so strange that the charges he faces They have to do with physical aggression because

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:32.480
it made it more difficult for him to be granted that bail. He did argue, eh. Yesterday when he had the

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.600
hearing for that bail, he argued that because he is a public figure, it is true that it is much more difficult for him

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.800
to leave the country. for example to go on the run eh but unfortunately for him that argument was not

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:47.480
enough for the magistrate judge eh tarnovsky So he appealed yesterday Today he had another hearing before

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.560
District Judge Carter and yet the judge also denied him bail for the truth is

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.880
that the charges are the ones the charges have to do with violent things the allegations eh They

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:02.160
also involve drug use and it is because of those reasons that he was denied bail the prison

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:07.800
he is in has a reputation for being very strict food insipid and good, especially for someone

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.040
who is used to all kinds of luxury like him, well, this is going to be hell, in fact,

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.640
here you have a photograph of the royal cell in which the well, as you can see, is a style of Jeffre

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.880
Estin's no but of course for a person it's not bad eh I mean it's really [ __ ] mother this is going to be

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.080
a prison What happens is that of course obviously being who he is well this is going to seem like

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:32.680
a prison Well they don't have what they need they Going To Leave got them there right need locks On The

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:42.400

Air conditioning Why is that Heat affects the alcohol and it also affects like um you know

00:20:52.200 --> 00:21:00.000
everybody, this one that I just saw is going viral because now with the passage of time,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.960
that joke that he made on the program during the show makes a little sense. interview o'brian

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:09.520
asked cams about the key elements to organizing a killer party The rapper mentioned

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.560
the presence of beautiful women and men for the ladies but the most controversial thing was this joke that

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.840
You just saw, okay, it arose when he joked about the need to keep women at

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.920
parties, suggesting that they should put locks on the doors so that they wouldn't leave. It should be remembered

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:28.600
that one of the crimes of which he is accused is kidnapping, it is said. that one of the people who

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.000
are scared by all this is Jennifer López, Jay Law herself, because well, you already know that

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.040
she was one of the most important people in Didy Camps's life, in fact, one of her

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:42.680
best-known relationships, Fiten talks about what is known. behind the scenes that Ben Afflek left

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:48.240
the relationship because he found out that Jennifer Lopez would have had relationships with minors

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.840
at These Parties. In fact, several images of Jennifer Lopez accompanying Didi at These Not So Peculiar Parties are going viral

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:58.800
and, above all, also that the case

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:03.840
of that shooting in a nightclub when she kept Didi's gun in her bag, do you remember

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.440
those very famous photos that traveled around the world of Jennifer López being booked by the police,

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.200
not the photos from the police file. Eh Well, apparently that topic is reopened and It seems that Jennifer López is playing again

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.400
because it wouldn't end very well or it might not end very well. Or rather,

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.680
and apparently, they would be a little scared, we'll see what happens, we'll see

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:27.720
what happens. I regarding I think that this topic will not be touched upon again, although obviously,

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.920
as it cannot be otherwise, this topic is very viral, many things are going to be removed and

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.920
many wounds are going to be reopened. You already know that it is quite likely that very documentaries will appear.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:42.000
extensive non-programs dedicated exclusively to the subject and pulling newspaper archive pulling newspaper archive

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.640
moving contacts interviews and I don't know what and I don't know how much you are already seeing that in this same

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.680

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.840
