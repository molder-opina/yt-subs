00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.840
It seems that the more days Didi spends in prison, the more alleged victims

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.560
are daring to come out to report the alleged shady or even criminal events that they had

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.400
experienced with Cindy Dicom. And you already know that during the time that Didi has been in prison

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.440
at ease around the planet doing whatever he wanted as if the planet had no laws

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.360
for him. Well, in fact, I would dare to say that even today there are still many people

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.800
who do not dare to open their mouths and who prefer stay on the sidelines, unlike the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.640
Jeffrey Epting case in which more famous people came out to speak and raise their voices in this It seems that there is

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.000
more fear that they have more respect for this guy, the point is that now it seems that people are

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.400
feeling a little more sure about the fact that Didy is in prison and they won't let him out despite

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.960
the multiple agreements he has tried with the judges offering a lot of millions a

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.720
lot of conditions that he is willing to accept later during the video I will tell you about them but

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.480
for example, even selling his private Je so that they do not understand a risk of flight and it is worth nothing to

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.760
the judges. In other words, he is not going to get out of prison and in fact it is stipulated that he could be sentenced in a

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.800
range of between 15 years and life imprisonment for What in this video I am going to tell you about the latest

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.120
things that are coming out and new alleged victims who are raising their voices and shouting

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.280
to the heavens with the atrocities that have happened with didcom. We are also going to talk about

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.440
an alleged intimate video with the who could be threatening Justin Bieber or at least have him

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:26.680

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.320
all those things that are free make yourself comfortable And let's go to the Leon before getting into the matter

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.600
the first thing I would like to update is the situation that Didi is having inside the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.880
prison at the moment and this morning his lawyer came out to give some statements to the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:59.840
press. He has answered few questions but we will know something after spending the whole morning with him,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.240
one of the things he has answered the lawyer It is on

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.880
the subject of the thousand bottles of drinking lubricant that were found in one of

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:29.840
the mansions that he justifies by saying that Americans usually buy in bulk

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:47.440
do cons ads you know getan to that someh sex is aad Thing Because If It was And what do you want me

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.320
to tell you? I have my doubts that Cindy c Daddy needs to buy and get offers at

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.280
the supermarket where she has to buy a lot to save a little on the price but well

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.920
, it is true that simply the The fact that it is baby lubricant would not mean that it is not

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.200
being used for consensual sex. This seems to me to be a somewhat curious piece of information, but not the most

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.160
important one that we have of all the indications and accusations against Paz Dadi, which

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.720
could almost be justified, although The other strong situation that is occurring in the last few

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.280
hours is a bit strange. It is about Kim Potter's diary. You already know that Kim Potter is one of

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.360
Cindy Dicom's longest-lived couples. She was his wife and mother of several of his children. He had a quite intermittent relationship

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.760
between 1994 and 2007 where they even stood still for years before returning sincerely in front of

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.680
the public at least They have always had a good relationship even after breaking up the relationship one

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.760
of the last publications of this woman was congratulating him as a father but yes It is true

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.440
that there are many people who have certain conspiracies about the reason for his death

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.880
and that is that in 2018, at only 47 years old, he died due to pneumonia and many people

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.200
suspected that this was something quite strange because there was talk that He was about to

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.680
release a book with all his memories telling a lot of things he had experienced among others in

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:12.920
constances that didy Had something to do with the Death of his ex Partner and the

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.800
mother to his children Woman named Kim Porter Now What happened was She

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.560
mysteriously Died of pneumonia at the Age of 47 not the typical way that a 47y old goes

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:30.000
out especially Just When They are about to publish a Tell all Book about their very Famous

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.600
That's What happened to Kim She Died of pneumonia at the Age of 47 years old well

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.480
Guess What It was Just announced Yesterday that kim's porter's Book is Being published It's a

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.200
60 page Book entitled kim's Lost words claims to be a Collection of the Diaries of Kim Porter the

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.080
mother of diddy's children and It was leaked by her Friends In The Book Porter allegedly

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.920
recounts discovering and making copies of the tapes that didy made of himself having with

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.640
young Boys that he was managing including an alleged tape involving an 18-year old

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.360
I am not going to deny that it could seem suspicious although I think that everything here also has a tinge

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.640
of Conspiracy but well yes it could be suspicious and even more so taking into account all the data that

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.720
Today we have all the things that we know that this man was capable of doing And he is capable of

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.680
doing how far he is able to go to achieve And manage to impose what he says or silence the

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.120
crowd, we will see what they say but for now the children deny it is seeing any

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.960
part of those supposed leaked memories in a book and It seems that the Source is Chris

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.360
Chris tot is a producer who claimed to be a good friend of Kim Potter and one of the few to whom

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.240
it is assumed that she happened his memoirs in a ucb so that he could read them before publishing them It seems

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.800
that this man has decided to publish them taking advantage of now that Didi is in jail And

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.360
well, the truth is that I have to say that it looks quite credible Although it is true that

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.920
There is no type of proof to prove its veracity. I organized parties that were nothing more than

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.640
a fancy name for [__] and everyone wanted to participate. The memories claimed that

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.600
we not only had threesomes but also exchanged partners. Our

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.840
sex life was crazy. But I was able to do things with Sean that I would never have been able to do with a

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.480
heterosexual man. In those supposed memoirs he told how it was the first time that Didi hit him, which

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.880
apparently was when he slapped her with his open hand in the face after she

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:26.920
rejected him. use a harness with a dildo then immediately He apologized to her claiming that

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.160
he had been a horny and describes many other episodes of attacks and threats but the most

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.440
talked about is the following some of the tapes had things that he would never have expected

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.320
gay parties are one thing but the young boys like two hip hop stars who were previously

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:50.600
representatives of Didi and La Estrella Del Pop who was 18 years old at the time. I would never have imagined it.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.720
I don't know how you understand this but people have taken it for something quite obvious and that is a

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.600
clear reference to Justin Bieber. It also seems that the editor of this supposed memoir

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.360
has told Daily Mail that apart from having had the USB, he has also had proof that King

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.800
sent him to some friends because how he used makeup to cover up the bruises and Well, what I think is

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:17.600
going to give the title to this video is surely the supposed video of Didi with a

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.920
teenage pop star that I can't think of anyone else other than Justin Bieber, it is certain

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.240
that Didi's sex video with the teenage pop star has been introduced to

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:36.920
Hollywood studios by is inter and What has Come on the heels of This is people unearthing videos of

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:42.040
Justin Bieber Justin Bieber at didy parties Now Justin Bieber was obviously extremely young when

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.400
he entered the Industry extremely innocent when he entered the Industry an Industry that he did

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.520
not quite understand as a boy Who Just knew How to sing and play the guitar and Just did both of

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.120
Those things on Youtube then He was scooped up and suddenly he was A Part Of people like

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.440
didy going after him and saying Hey man Why won you pick up my phone calls It's actually

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.840
a rather curious clip that people comment on a lot and it's this one that I'm going to put

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.880
below where It seems that between goodbyes and hugs he worries a lot about touching

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.120
to Justin Bieber and It seems that he would be recording and making sure that he does not have a

00:08:36.120 --> 00:09:03.680
microphone esing to leak peace Daddy's information. So if Daddy was so interested

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.440
in recording to see if he has a microphone in case he has recorded something from this meeting, then surely

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.800
because they have met to talk about something shady or because who knows what happened in

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.720
the event that the theory that he was feeling to see if there is a bug was true,

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.080
I don't know how to tell me what you thought just a few hours ago Kim Potter's children and Didi have

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:26.240
come out to deny this book that is going to come out with those memories, saying that it is absolutely false

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.080
that her mother has never written anything like that, that she has not left any type of memories anywhere

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.600
and that obviously, in case it is necessary to emphasize it, death of his mother at

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.840
47 years old was something completely natural due to pneumonia and that anyone who invents

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:46.120
the opposite or any type of thing in those memoirs is obviously not his friend,

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.920
referring to krot, that is, it seems that the children are not Happy with what this

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.680
producer is doing, they have asked for respect for their mother's memory and Amazon has removed the

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.720
book after they requested it. It is true that the last thing she published on her

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.360
Instagram account was this photograph congratulating her ex or Whether it's Didi for her birthday and stating

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.520
that she feels proud of how she is as a father, I'll tell you one thing, or whether a man can be the worst

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:15.000
person in the world with people or be a terrible self who knows a thousand things and then maybe it's a good

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
father I don't know, I think one thing doesn't rule out the other. We have seen so many hurtful and

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.480
false humor circulating about our parents, Kim Porter and Sean Coms' relationship, as well as the tragic

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:34.160
death of our mother that we feel the need to speak out. Claims that

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.080
our mother wrote a book are simply false, she did not and anyone who claims

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.800
to have a manuscript is misrepresenting themselves. Additionally, please understand that any so-called

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.680
friend who speaks on behalf of our mother or her family is not a friend nor does she have her best

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:56.160
interests at heart our lives were shattered when we lost our mother

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:01.800
she was our world and nothing has been the same since she passed away although it has been incredibly

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.880
difficult to reconcile how she could be taken from us too soon the cause of her death has

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:13.480
been established for a long time there was no foul play Grieving is a lifelong process and

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.000
we ask that everyone respect our request for peace as we continue to deal with his loss

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.560
each day we are deeply saddened that the world has given such a spectacle which

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.400
has been the most tragic event of our lives our mother should be remembered for what a beautiful

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:33.280
strong kind and loving woman she was her memory should not be tainted by horrible

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:39.560
Conspiracy theories We ask everyone to respect our mother Kim Porter and keep her legacy

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:45.400
in high esteem so that she can rest in peace is what she deserves we love you and we miss you

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:53.440
mommy kin Cristian Jessi and delila the fact that there are videos found is a fact in one of the

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.480
raids you can find it in any of the news that talk about this topic. In fact,

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.720
we have a first video where I go into depth about these investigations. Well, several videos. In

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.800
fact, I recommend that you go to the playlist that is on the Channel. In fact,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.240
if you want to know all the information about this topic, but It is not yet known what type of videos

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:14.280
they are, exactly which Hollywood stars they involve and more than doubts. Well, I think that

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:19.040
would explain the silence of many. Yes, it is quite strange, eh, or the fact that with the case of

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.560
Johnny Depp and Amber for example of Jeffrey there is also something but especially in the case of John

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.600
for example a lot of actors and hyper mega powerful people spoke out. They had no

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.520
problems in positioning themselves while we were following the case we saw how there were people who

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:37.520
stopped following Amber or that put out statements against Johnny but in this case not in this

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:43.120
case it is that they are trying to tiptoe and there is an overwhelming silence the only one who gets wet

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.680
but like with two [ __ ] is f zen or 50 zen as I call it Well, he has already reached an

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:53.720
agreement with Netflix in which he is preparing a documentary that I believe is going to be the most

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.080
complete that talks about this topic where he is going to expose Paz Daddy. We are talking about what

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.120
fyen apart from having a lot of Manía for him. He has been investigating Paz for years with private investigators

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.200
Daddy, that's why I tell you that I think I'm not wrong when I think that this documentary is going to be the most

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.480
complete. There are others like Eminen who have said things in their songs. What happens is that you already know this

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.680
thing they have, not that they are supposed to rap lyrics or bullshit in music because

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.560
they don't have the same weight as when they are said when they are said outside of a song, I mean, I don't

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.040
see the point, we have discussed this, and I have even had debates on my channel with People from this

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.120
Cock Battles didn't say that it's good that it was a bullfight and in the battles

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.360
Well, it's fiction to say things to each other But well, I see it as nonsense I see that what you say

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.240
in a song is that you are interpreting it in some way your feelings or what you think

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.400
let's see I hope to pronounce it correctly Nike hiton is this singer that you are seeing on the screen

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:48.800
well she is very well known she is very popular she narrated a pretty strong episode I mean this episode

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.200
is very very very bad I don't know Even if a youtuber tells me You can censor the editor is going to try

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:59.040
to put a little filter on sensitive words But well basically there was non-consensual touching

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.640
by did with an executive producer after trying to give them a drink with

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.960
drugs in it that ended with her running out of the place Although

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:29.160
yes it is true that I do not understand why this girl has not demanded for the moment

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.080
to do Reach for my phone And I Start to type and with takes The Phone out of my

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.120
hand and He's like Who are you texting like you don't need to text anyone like

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.360
we're having a Party And I was like Okay and he like puts it on One of the speakers

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:45.280
and I'm like fuck Now What do I do um like I I don't I don't know what to do and I see my

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:52.560
manager take a sip and I'm like fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck Now What do I do and then I see

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:59.040
her Take another sip two sips out have this Little vodka Cranberry Cup and I'm like Oh

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:09.120
What do I What do I do two sips And I watch her Face flush And All of a sudden like I look over

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.000
and She's speaking really loud and like making jokes and I'm like I just knew that the drinks

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.800
were all laced with something um and She starts like Almost Being like belligerent a little bit

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.800
but not like a Crazy way Just like really enjoying herself and I'm like That's not her That's not her

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.960
She doesn't even want to be here like This is weird realize that I'm in the Studio with did

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:36.800
and with and the off their shit and there's three other men an executive that works with kanye his

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:42.920
engineer and his cousin and me I'm like you guys stop like stop stop and they're Getting

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:48.480
to the point Where they have like ripped my shirt off and um like I'm like Almost fully exposed at

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:55.080
this Point and they're both coming at Me And I'm like you guys seriously This is this isn't funny

00:15:55.080 --> 00:16:01.160
Anymore And I look to my left Where his executive Is Like We know him Pretty well like we've been

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:07.920
around him a lot He's literally 3 Feet away from Me Like If I reached and he reached you like we

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.320
could Touch like He's that Close And I look and I'm like Hey like I give that look Where

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.200
I'm just like Come on like Step in like this isn't cool like You're a grown man like You're like 50

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.520
years old I know you have a family like you know this isn't right like do something and This is

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:27.680
the Part that for as long as I Live I will never fucking forget it isn't actually the aspect of

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:35.880
Being sexually assaulted That's not What haunts me It's It's this It's as these two grown men

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:44.640
were off I look over To This Man asking for help And I literally Mouth the word help and we lock

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:55.600
eyes and he looks away I'm like Okay there's two more men in the room And I look to his engineer

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:01.600
next he was sitting right Right Next To him And I Know that He's married and he has he Just Had

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.240
a little baby girl and I'm like Okay He's Going To Do something and he looks down at his phone

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:12.120
and starts texting no one's Going To Do anything no one's Going To Do fucking anything and That's

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:20.480
When I was truly fucking scared trying to Get my And I realized That I was completely Alone And

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:30.560
um I closed My Eyes for a Second And I was like God help I think about this thing about putting complaints

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.680
in public in programs and on social networks, complaints have to be made in court

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:39.600
I understand that the girl might be afraid to do it so that they wouldn't close doors on her or I

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.200
know that something would happen to her, but I imagine that now that Didi is in jail, I understand that

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.280
now she will take measures and this will be added to the causes that Didi has. It is inevitable to compare

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:52.440
this case with that of Jeffrey Epin. By the way, you also have a series on this channel about

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.840
that case and in fact I think it is very similar and it shows us once again how disgusting

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.720
what is always behind the power. I think that this is a bit in all the elites,

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.160
always these types of issues, no, and in the end the business world has a lot of

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:10.440
mafia corruption, speaking half in quotes, okay, keep quiet, you have to be false, whatever it

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.800
is, eh, whether it's the world of Hollywood TV, even very powerful streamers, the

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.640
business world in general is a bit like that. Well, I don't know if it's even comparable, let's not say it's not.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.480
At the same level, organizing the filth and filth of the hyper mega global elite level

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:29.040
to be able to stop even the FBI than to organize parties for Hollywood perverts

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:34.760
On A Jet flying around the world Now it started On A tuesday somehow ended On The previous Sunday I

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.080
don't know how he did that Now that I'm engaged I decided to Slow Down a little three days parties a

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:50.120
week Maybe Four not including the weekends One Day we went To This Party forg pimp Cup went to Had

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:58.720
a pimp cup he Had a whole bunch of pimp ca pimp set It's hard to say which is more off the ha did

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:16.680
in the end jeffre was so afraid to speak or say anything that he could have said

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.360
that you know how he ended up seeing if it is true that the people who would want to silence him in the case

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.600
of Didi would not be the same in any case to Didi I wanted to silence him, people like Will me LeBron

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:30.200
Janes Leonardo DiCaprio are not people with as much power as what Jeffrey

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.840
Esting had at the top, but it is true that there are many people who are afraid of him, there are also many other people

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.800
who really want him. for all the bad things she has done in life Didi She received the

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:45.480
first complaint for rape and abuse in 1990 then another in 1991 then in 1999 another for harassment

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:51.360
and the nightclub shooting with Jennifer Lopez in 2003 another for sexual abuse in 2012 She blew

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.560
up her ex Kid Coody's boyfriend's car with explosives. You have this in a video. I

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:02.480
remind you of it in 2015 for assault. In 2018, she hit Casey. In 2022, the complaint from producer

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:07.240
John for abuse. And in this last year, three other complaints. for sexual abuse and we are talking

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.160
about complaints from victims who have dared to report there are many others who speak and who

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.760
know each other from behind that they are bz populis who have not reported Eh This without also counting the issue of

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.520
carrying weapons and the alleged involvement in the murder of Tupac And then how has he gotten rid of

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:25.800
all these years of so many things, well, the money is the power. I read the conditions that he had

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.960
offered to the judges in this last week for his conditional release while

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.080
the trial was being held. case and not the bail 100 million dollars not having visits from women at home

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.080
who were not his service employees his relatives his mansion and his mother's mansion

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:46.640
as collateral security cameras with real-time police surveillance in his house and GPS tracking

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:51.920
alcohol and drug test when he wanted to give up his entire family's

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.760
passports, his is already canceled for obvious reasons and even sell his plane to

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.320
show that he did not intend to gamble. The move here is that the issue of peace Dad It is not only

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:06.120
for reasons of flight risk but he is not allowed to leave jail so that he does not try to

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:12.360
blackmail or offer something so that the Witnesses or possible witnesses can change the version and not

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:18.240
only with a plan to try to make agreements but You already know that Paz Dad has a very

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:24.080
good relationship with gangster gangs since the 90s. I think you will agree with me that

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.680
the turning point at which people took a turn was if there was someone who did not believe that this

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.640
man had been able to do all these things and I only thought that they would be conspiracies and

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.560
things that are said about famous people was the moment in which the video was made public where he hits

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.000
casy We also have a video on this topic, I recommend that you watch it But well, I said it,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.760
okay, there is a playlist with all the things and we are completely up to date. It is always

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.600
true that no matter how many testimonies there are, there are many people who talk, it is not the case. same when there is

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:54.920
a super graphic illustrative video in such a flagrant way and it is the same thing that we talked about At that

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.640
moment when the video was published Not if this is done to you in the hallways of a hotel, what is it

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.520
that does to you when you don't believe that it they are recording is that before this video many

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:08.520
things could be like urban legends stories no eh creepy legs I already told you no

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:13.240
conspiracy beliefs but no no that video shows that eh what is said about it could be true

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:18.440
almost everything if not everything goes The mayor of New York Eric Adams, the same one who gave the key to the

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:23.680
city to Didi on the same day her album came out, most likely with the intention of promoting it, today

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.720
has precisely been accused by a prosecutor of corruption. It is not ruled out that in addition

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.200
to the case of corruption this man has also included the investigation of the

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:58.560
did case and to finish today's case we will return to touch a little

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.640
on the topic of Jennifer López who seems to be shaking if the

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.520
case in which she was involved is removed again and for which Didi almost got

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.320
Jennifer Lopez to end with a criminal record that this would probably have ruined her

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:16.960
career

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:32.480
puon of wenderson nowt during the trial fenderson testified That colmes Was armed the Night of the

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.640
Shooting at Club New York and later pressured him to claim ownership of a pistol police Found

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:43.080
When they pulled over coles Lincoln Navigator as it fled the Shooting and Just Jennifer Lopez

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.760
Who was in the Navigator When It was stopped by police an officer testified that everyone in the

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:53.680
suv was ordered to put their hands on the vehicle but Lopez walked away saying She was going home

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:58.440
as She was Being detained a gun was discovered in the vehicle at that Point A sergeant On The

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.200
I do obviously believe that this gun was not Jennifer López's and the move is

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.200
that however and surprisingly It seems that to this day Jennifer Lopez still has

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:28.360
a good vibe with Didi, she even continues to be at some parties and collaborating with him

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.600
and Well in that case you already know that this man paid the price. The rapper

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.640
Shan who to this day despite having served the punishment, he continues to say that

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:58.640
he is innocent, this is a curious case that I think will give much more to talk about than the

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:04.120
record executive and criminal with Víctor but an expert in the Didi industry, he stated that

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:10.520
Jennifer López's breakup with Ben aflex It is very possibly due to the things that she hides from

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:19.640
Didi vide J doing this J doing that they know the

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:28.320
J or Whatever his Life

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.760
according to this man Jennifer López would appear in some of the tapes that have been found in

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.400
Didi's house, this is not He is saying only he, I think in the previous video we actually

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:55.400
mentioned that I don't know if it was F who also mentioned it so well as the
