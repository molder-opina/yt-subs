to <00:12:25.332><c>pay </c><00:12:25.465><c>for </c><00:12:25.598><c>her, </c><00:12:25.731><c>right?  </c><00:12:25.864><c>Because </c><00:12:25.997><c>it</c>

00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
to pay for her, right?  Because it
 

00:12:26.199 --> 00:12:27.030 align:start position:0%
to pay for her, right?  Because it
has <00:12:26.369><c>the </c><00:12:26.539><c>dimension </c><00:12:26.709><c>of </c><00:12:26.879><c>a</c>

pay <00:12:29.180><c>her </c><00:12:29.880><c>to</c>

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:29.959 align:start position:0%
