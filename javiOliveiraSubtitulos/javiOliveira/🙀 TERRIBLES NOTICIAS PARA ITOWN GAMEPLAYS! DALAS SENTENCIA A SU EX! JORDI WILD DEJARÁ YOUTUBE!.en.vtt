00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
of course the hearing is not there now I mean
 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.450 align:start position:0%
of course the hearing is not there now I mean
the <00:05:18.779><c>hearing </c><00:05:19.079><c>is </c><00:05:19.379><c>like </c><00:05:19.679><c>what </c><00:05:19.979><c>the </c><00:05:20.279><c>organization</c>

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
the hearing is like what the organization

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:23.629 align:start position:0%
is like above the judge no

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
So what does the judge do take in the
 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.310 align:start position:0%
So what does the judge do take in the
sentence <00:05:23.951><c>put </c><00:05:24.263><c>this </c><00:05:24.575><c>liter </c><00:05:24.887><c>I </c><00:05:25.199><c>cannot</c>
