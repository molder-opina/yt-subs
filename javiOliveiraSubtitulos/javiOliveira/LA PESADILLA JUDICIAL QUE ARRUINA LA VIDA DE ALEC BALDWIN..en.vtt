00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.960
Although he doesn't lack good money
to have people to help him

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.960
constantly, it still shouldn't be
easy. Alex Balwin has also been an

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.680
activist against the legal carrying of weapons
asking for more controls and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.320
stricter laws in the United States Although
he has also been a quite

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.439
controversial person, he has been involved in
some minor incidents such as

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.280

alwin began the recordings of his

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.080
rash film project in the who, apart
from being the agonist actor, is also the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.560
producer. As the producer of the film,
he has several responsibilities such as

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.760
contracts,
organizational aspects or even in some cases

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.360
financing the film. The budget of
the film was 8 million dollars

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.319
, which, well, is not enough for a great
production but there have been many

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.640
films with this budget and with
much less they had a few

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.280
protests throughout the filming by
the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.519

it was a real 45 caliber bullet that

the director wants, that is, the shot is
incredible, contrast light, zoom

focus, both on her website where
we can see some of her work

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.000
and on her personal Instagram where
she uploaded a photograph, you can see that the

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.680
girl had talent. undoubtedly
to take very good photos and videos,

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.159
we can see that the last things he
uploaded to his Instagram was a photo with the

00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:59.560
cast of the film supporting the
theater actors affected by the

that you can ride a horse on your day

off when the girl was still alive.
Alex Balwin was interrogated and what he

00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:31.720
stated throughout the entire time was that
When they gave him the weapon, he trusted

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:37.680
that it was a cold weapon, that is, a weapon
that was not loaded and could not cause

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.200
harm.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.399
The person in charge of the weapons showed the
supervisor the weapon, he gave her the OK and

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:09.720
she gave it to

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.600

the gunsmith sometimes asks the
actor if he wants to check the gun But

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.240
he thinks it's an insult to his
profession so he doesn't

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.120
do it

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.079
if a gun expert is giving you the
weapon and it is assumed that he has told you that the

00:10:07.079 --> 00:10:10.040
weapon is safe and that there is no
problem with it because you are supposed

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.360
to believe him and I say It is assumed
because later I am going to

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.200
tell you what the real protocol is that

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.600
there is
also Alex affirms Since it was a rehearsal,

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.399
the gun should have been empty or
at most with prop bullets. He

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:40.839
fights for his innocence because he understood
that they gave him a cold weapon that was revised and

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:43.040
without

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.839
ammunition. Something very intelligent that
Alex Balwin says. I imagine that

00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:58.040
he is completely advised. he did not
fire the gun and the gun went off

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.040
by itself

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.780
[Music]

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:23.600
if you claim that he pulled the trigger this
would also be involuntary manslaughter

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.959
so he claims that he turned
the hammer and the revolver

00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:30.959
went off

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.279
at the end of this interrogation they inform him
of the death of the girl and this

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:44.639
was his

00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:00.959
reaction

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.759
[Music]

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:25.800
valwin granted an interview in which
he has all kinds of details

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.880
How he experienced that moment and how he
shot himself

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.920
andun

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:50.880

so I
take the gun And I Start to cock the gun

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.959
I'm Not Going To Pull the Trigger I said

00:13:22.959 --> 00:13:26.480

I Let go

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.959
and suddenly the gun went off with the
bad luck that she was

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.639
pierced

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:50.720

Never that Was the training That I Had

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.399
you the family is

00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:00.759
saying

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:05.120
the hammer It is what is used to load
the gun This is a step to fire the

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.360
revolver but it is not on YouTube
I am allowed to explain to you how it works

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.160
, but this type of 150-year-old weapon
depends on the state in which it is

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.480
found. Yes, it can be
fired at first. In addition

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.759
to the demands from the family,
the prosecutor's office does charge a pair

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:24.680
of crimes On the one hand, an investigation is opened
for carrying weapons which

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.680
was withdrawn because it was a law
after

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.680
2021

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.920
and this about the shot that
was finally also withdrawn by the

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:47.959
prosecutor's office

00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:56.720
although they thought it was unlikely
that the gun would fire itself

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.440
But since they could not prove otherwise,
they also decided to withdraw the

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.279
charge of involuntary manslaughter in

00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:18.440
2023. Therefore, at the beginning of 2023, more
specifically in January, Balwin would be

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.160
completely

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.639
clean in the United States. The image of
the institutions is very important

00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:32.519
in the media and the prosecution found
very likely to lose this trial for not

00:15:32.519 --> 00:15:36.240
being able to prove that Alex balwin was
guilty of involuntary manslaughter, so

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.839
rather than look ridiculous or
bad in front of the citizens, they decided

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:43.360
to withdraw the

00:15:44.279 --> 00:15:50.279
charge without pulling the Trigger but
balwi not guilty INS in interview with

the FBI, which initially said that the

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.279
gun could not fire itself, doing
alarm tests to see if it was possible

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:09.079
for it to fire, ended up damaging some
parts that they did not replace properly, so

00:16:09.079 --> 00:16:13.399
the most important test was
loaded and repaired badly when you the

[Music]
However, with the case closed due to

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:48.360
withdrawal of charges, the prosecutors decided
to take the weapon where some

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.000
prosecutors' experts and FBI assistants
reconstructed it with original parts and

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.079
determined that it apparently required more
force than necessary. to shoot himself so

00:16:56.079 --> 00:17:00.160
he could only have pulled the
trigger alec Baldwin called you

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:05.360
afterwards and It was an embrace and a
meal What tell me what that was like I

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.000
feel like to understand that moment you
have to remember the shock we were

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.319
in And I spoke with Mr Baldwin was Just
looking for a way through the Storm was

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:17.280
did he seem distracting during that Time
there were a lot of emotions for sure on

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.480
both sides Just felt so Angry Just so
Angry to see him talk about her Death so

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.799
publicly in such a detailed way to not
accept Any responsibility after having

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:30.400
Just described killing her he said

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.799

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:53.919
one
I agreed with Al Balwin and I didn't want prison

00:17:53.919 --> 00:17:56.080
for

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.120
him and the film's producers are going
Forward and What does the settlement

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.320
mean Now in terms of an investigation
that type of Thing we don't know much

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.880
about the settlement like the Dollar
amounts and That's not unusual normally

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:12.559
in a High value settlement like this in
a High profile Case It is Hush Hush

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:16.760
usually One of the conditions is that
the Dollar amount not be released lest

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.880
the defendants create a sea of ​​swimming
sharks Looking to Circle and come and

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.679
sue them for some other reason Apparently
it was a verbal agreement and a

00:18:24.679 --> 00:18:29.720
fairly financial agreement Well in fact
Al's husband was named

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:35.360
executive producer of the film so he will
take a percentage I imagine of the

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.520
profits is unusual is the statement
That was released by Mr Hutch Now that

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.159
statement could be read as a press
Release about the settlement but as an

00:18:45.159 --> 00:18:49.120
attorney you Look at that statement and
it seemed to me to be a Direct morse

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.960
code message to the Santa da's Office to
say

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.919
look

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:02.000
longer
crime keep

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.400
asking for charges if you want

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.520
to do it but it does complicate it a
bit because the victim's family no

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:17.559
longer wants charges against Alex
practicality is once a victim no longer

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:23.720
considers them a victim or doesn't want
to cooperate the case becomes harder

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:30.240
canu
agre

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.360
The prosecutors had another way to
reopen the case and that was to take it to a grand

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.799
jury. It is different from a jury because
it does not sentence. Its function is to review

00:19:43.799 --> 00:19:47.600
whether the evidence is sufficient to
start a trial. They saw this

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:54.280
new evidence and decided to start a
murder trial. involuntary against

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.240
Balwin,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.320
as we can see, several experts affirm
or would assure or at least they

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.080
think that the fact that he is famous
influenced the accusation

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:13.039
of involuntary manslaughter to be opened. I also
believe it, I don't know what

00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:28.799
you will think, this expert also affirms that
these changes in the prosecutor who have

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:32.520
many doubts and that a Jury of 12
people making the accusation will have

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.799
many more so it is a good sign
for Alex Balwin's defense team.

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:46.000
I personally think it is a
painful idea to reopen the case now if the

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.280
evidence and the prosecution had doubts With
12 people they are not going to be clarified and

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.960
basically to convict someone
everything has to be very clear and here the

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.799
thing is not Clear yes it is true that
the gun can fire itself but

00:20:57.799 --> 00:21:00.960
it is also true that it is It is true that it is very
likely that Alex Balwin pulled the

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.480
trigger even though he was completely
unconscious and evidently thought that

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.440
the gun was unloaded, that the bullet was not going to be
fired and evidently

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.880
he did not intend to. But there are some
safety rules when it comes to these

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.760
shoots that there are. to strictly comply,
especially when we have

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.360
something as dangerous as a revolver in our hand
, when you are with this type of gadget

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:25.159
you have to keep in mind that all
weapons are always loaded. Never leave

00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:30.760
the barrel pointing at something that you are not
intended to destroy. keep your finger out

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.720
of the trigger until you are going to pull it and
identify your objective and what is

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.640
behind it, the fact is that if it can be
proven that Alex pulled the trigger,

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:44.840
it would be involuntary manslaughter, for which
he would have 18 years in prison, which he

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:49.360
will most likely not serve within of
jail and it would be a conditional prison

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:55.080
plus a responsible bail
agreement What happen with

00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:00.480
gun Because the
Gun unfortunate What happen I know makes

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:07.120
you sick but it happen Because you
decided to do What you

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.080
gun the only way to get rid of these
charges is Basically what

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.039
he and his defense are doing is stating
that he thought the gun was fake

00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:18.600
that it was a toy that was not loaded
of course and that he did not pull the trigger

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.640
if he does not get off that donkey I think
they are not going to impute no joke in the

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.960
last two years both Alex and his
wife have had several

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:31.760
unpleasant encounters with the press because
obviously they do not stop asking him about the

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:02.159
issue and we have to understand why this is
like this although the victim is who he is and from

00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:05.679
there it does not We get off for him and it's not a
tasteful dish either because it's not something

00:23:05.679 --> 00:23:09.240
that even though it was
neglected for a second

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.440
it's obviously not pleasant for

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:18.640
him
film nott Whatever other people decide

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:26.880
Is Best to go in ter People sail All in
of do you think Production Start up

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.880
again

00:23:33.799 --> 00:23:37.720
we are talking about a person for whom
I had appreciation and a certain affection Because

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.000
they were

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.919
colleagues
ando

00:23:48.919 --> 00:23:52.760
and not

00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:00.960
human and Okay but of course here the
question that we all have to ask ourselves

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.200
is how some real bullets got to a
recording set and this is where

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:10.480
hann Gutiérrez comes in ridy hana Gutiérrez daughter
of one of the most important gunsmiths in

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.600
the history of Hollywood but with little
experience since it was her second

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.279
film in her first film she had a
problem since she was shooting

00:24:17.279 --> 00:24:22.240
a gun near the team and of ncolas K
without prior notice which made him

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:26.640
yell at her and leave the set angrily, however
in the filming of ras she was

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.480
doing everything right until she gave a
loaded gun to Alex Balwin. If we see the

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.880
recreation she enters and shows him the
David Hall, deputy director of the

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.120
film and security officer, was already
sentenced as a co-author of involuntary manslaughter

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:43.159
by not verifying that the
bullets were real and accepting the charge. He was

00:24:43.159 --> 00:24:50.520
sentenced to 6 months in prison for
the fact that he sees the revolver and when he saw it with

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:55.600
bullets he must have prohibit it and so he would think that
they were prop or blank bullets since

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.480
it was a rehearsal, they are easy to recognize,
knowing the fake bullets because they are

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:04.039
hollow and when shaken they usually have a
bell that rings, so the guy did not

00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:08.799
do his job well and it was a complete
negligence, something that Dave's lawyer says

00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:12.720
is that he confirms that Alex Balwin
did not fire the gun and that he never put his

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.720
hand on the trigger. Hann stated that she
had the weapons in her car but that the

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.520
ammunition was brought by other suppliers
. gunmaker who has managed

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:24.720
to delay his trial until the end of
February 2024, when it will be played,

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.159
blamed the ammunition supplier for the
arrival of the real ones, something that they

00:25:29.159 --> 00:25:33.720
deny, that is, basically at this point
the riso is being riled up, it is worth Alex

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.679
Balwin stating that he does not shot that he
did not remember to pull the trigger I don't know

00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:41.240
there may be doubts about that but we cannot
prove otherwise but I

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.399
personally do think that he did not
shoot believing that he was counting

00:25:45.399 --> 00:25:49.039
on the fact that he had passed through the
supervisors that he had to pass The gun

00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:52.880
and When they gave it to him
it was evidently a sure thing, he wasn't going to think that

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.960
it was a weapon that was going to shoot anyone
and much less pointing it at someone.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.679
where I was, it was a complete oversight
but this girl's thing

00:26:00.679 --> 00:26:03.279
is to curl the

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.760
loop first of all the
supervisor's filter that condemned man already

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.279
[__] completely did not do his

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.600
job

00:26:36.919 --> 00:26:40.880
but if we go to her she is
blaming the supplier that is Like

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.679
she ordered the fake bullets,
let's say the blank ones were

00:26:44.679 --> 00:26:49.200
real bullets and I didn't know it

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.600
anymore.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.760
Four rounds that were Close Enough to
take in with them they're not a match

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.240
but they were Close there's something

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.120
very me personally I would like to sign
that this girl has great

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:29.520
responsibility in what has happened
a lot

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.240
. In conclusion, this is everything that has
happened with Alex Balwin, waiting to

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.120
see if he is charged. And if there is a trial at
some point in this case, I

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.640
personally think that it is very
complicated to prove that this man is

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.200
responsible for involuntary manslaughter,
he could have

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.000
really pulled the trigger even if it was without any
intention of course. But between the

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.600
errors during the investigation and
added to the fact that the family does not want to

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.399
charge

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.880
him anymore, for me what he did It is not cancelable,
obviously it is clear that it is an

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:22.720
accident, these are things that unfortunately
happen and no one wants them to happen of

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:30.880
course
. Likewise, if you condemn him, he would not go to

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.880
jail, we are talking about 18 months
in prison that would surely be solved

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.640
with some agreement and with freedom

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:46.980
[Music]

00:28:56.399 --> 00:29:00.840
conditional of course to the Dalina family
who unfortunately left

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.000
a 10 year

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:19.450
old boy in the world
